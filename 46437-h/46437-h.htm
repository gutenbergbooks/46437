  <h1 class='c006'>THE TRAGEDY OF WILD RIVER VALLEY.</h1>
</div>

<div>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER I.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008' >Along a quiet road a man was walking at a
steady, swinging pace. He was above the
medium height, strongly built, and his erect
carriage bespoke him one accustomed to military
drill, while the knapsack swung over his
shoulder and the blue overcoat on his arm
seemed to indicate that he was one of the returning
veterans of the lately disbanded Union
army.</p>

<p class='c009' >His face, young and strongly Celtic in feature,
was not unhandsome, though marred by a
sinister expression. It was that of a bold, bad
man on the alert to better his own fortunes
without regard to the rights of others; and as
he pressed onward he sent many a covetous
glance toward the comfortable farmhouses,
orchards, and rich harvest fields on either hand.</p>

<p class='c009' >At length, turning aside from the main road
and making his way through a bit of woods, he
paused in front of a rude cabin standing in a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_2' id='Page_2'>2</a></span>
potato patch, enclosed by a rough, zigzag rail-fence.
An old man in patched, worn, and by
no means clean garments sat on the door-step
smoking a dirty pipe.</p>

<p class='c009' >His wife stood just behind him with her knitting,
a coarse woollen stocking, in her hands.
She threw it from her as the traveller opened
the gate, and with a wild cry, “It’s me son!
me bye Phalim come home till his mither at
last!” rushed out and threw herself upon his
breast, weeping for very joy.</p>

<p class='c009' >He returned her embrace with ardor almost
equal to her own, filial affection so softening his
countenance that the evil look was banished for
the moment.</p>

<p class='c009' >The old man rose with trembling eagerness
and grasped his son’s hand. “An’ it’s yersilf,
lad!” he cried. “Thank the blessed Vargin
an’ all the howly saints that ye’ve come back
till yer mither an’ me alive an’ well afther all
the fightin’ ye’ve been in!”</p>

<p class='c009' >There were rapid questions and answers,
knapsack and overcoat were bestowed within
the cabin, a chair or two were brought out into
the shade before the door, and with a pipe
apiece and a bottle of whiskey the three made
themselves comfortable, while Phelim gave an
account of his wanderings and exploits, inventing,
embellishing, or suppressing occurrences
as suited his fancy.</p>

<p class='c009' >“An’ have yees made yer fortin, Phalim, me
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_3' id='Page_3'>3</a></span>
lad?” queried his mother, regarding him with
a look of maternal pride and fondness.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Not jist yit, ould lady,” he answered, with
an unpleasant laugh; “but,” pulling out a handful
of gold and silver coins and a roll of bank-notes,
“here’s the beginnin’ o’t.”</p>

<p class='c009' >She reached out an eager hand, while her
old eyes reflected the covetous gleam in his.
“Ye’ll share wid yer ould fayther and mither,
Phalim, me darlint?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Wan o’ these days maybe,” he said, returning
the money to his pocket. “I’m goin’ intil
a line av business that’ll pay; an’ I’ll have yees
soon livin’ in betther style,” he said, with a contemptuous
glance at their mean and squalid
surroundings.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Them’s not all sodger’s wages, me lad,”
remarked the old man, with a knowing look.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Did yees iver hear o’ bounty-jumpin’?”
returned his son, with a coarse laugh. “It’s
been a dangerous business, but, faith, a payin’
wan, too; an’ a smart chap cud foind chances
now an’ agin to hilp hisself amang the rebs an’
the wounded.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“An’ Phalim wasn’t the bye to neglict his
chances; was ye, lad?” chuckled the old father.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Niver a bit o’t, dad; an’ it’s mesilf, Phalim
O’Rourke, as manes to be a moighty rich man
wan o’ these days. Me gurrul, Belinda, shall
roide intil her coach an’ wear her foine goold
ornaments an’ her silks an’ satins wid the best.”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_4' id='Page_4'>4</a></span>
But observing significant glances passing between
the old people, while his mother took her
pipe from her mouth and shook her head ruefully,
“What’s wrong?” he demanded, the
color paling on his sunburnt cheek; “don’t
tell me annything’s happened till her, the purtiest
and swatest gurrul in Ameriky!”</p>

<p class='c009' >At that his mother burst out into an angry
denunciation of the girl; she was unworthy
of his love; she was faithless; she had been
married for a year to an old farmer living some
miles away. The man was well off, and his
money, house, and land had bought the silly,
faithless creature.</p>

<p class='c009' >Phelim’s face grew white with disappointment
and rage as he listened to the tale; he
clinched his fists and swore with horrible oaths
that he would be revenged upon them both.
He would shoot the old man dead in his tracks
and blow out the brains of the faithless girl.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Aisy, aisy, Phalim, me darlint! don’t yees
be afther runnin’ yer neck intil a halter for the
loikes av thim, the warthless varmints,” returned
his mother, alarmed at his vehemence.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Sorra a bit o’ that same,” he growled;
“there’s niver a bit o’ hangin’ in this State.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Eh! no; are yees sure o’ that same?” she
exclaimed, in surprise. “An’ what fur wadn’t
they be for takin’ the loives o’ thim as takes
other folk’s?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“It’s agin the law,” he answered, shortly.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_5' id='Page_5'>5</a></span>
“State’s prison for life’s near about as bad as
swingin’,” suggested the old man.</p>

<p class='c009' >“But while there’s life there’s hope,” remarked
his son, significantly; “hope o’ breakin’
jail or being pardoned out; an’ it’s mesilf as
wadn’t be afeared to take me chance o’ one or
t’other.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Ye wuz always a brave bye an’ a lucky
wan, Phalim,” was his mother’s comment as
she rose and set about preparing the evening
meal.</p>

<p class='c009' >When the hour for retiring came Phelim declined
to sleep in the house, averring that long
use had made mother earth a more comfortable
couch to him than the softest of beds, and
taught him that he could breathe more freely
under the open sky than beneath any roof.
Spreading his army blanket under a tree some
hundreds of yards distant from the cabin, he
threw himself down upon it and fell asleep.</p>

<p class='c009' >Hours passed on, while all was quiet save the
murmur of a brook near at hand and the rustle
of the night wind in the treetops; then a shrill
whistle roused him.</p>

<p class='c009' >He started up and listened. It came again,
louder, shriller than before. He answered it,
and moved swiftly in the direction of the sound,
which seemed to come from the road from
which he had yesterday turned aside to gain
his father’s dwelling. It was long past midnight,
but darkness still brooded over the land,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_6' id='Page_6'>6</a></span>
and few were abroad save those bent upon evil
deeds. To that class belonged Phelim and
those who had summoned him to their aid. In
the shadow of the trees bordering the roadside
lurked three men awaiting the coming of their
leader; for such Phelim was.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Where are yees, byes?” he asked in an
undertone as he drew cautiously near.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Here, sor,” replied a suppressed voice, in
as rich a brogue as his own.</p>

<p class='c009' >The three joined him, and a whispered conference
ensued, the chief speaker being one who
answered to the name of Teddy McManus.
He was describing a country-seat, the situation
of doors and windows, arrangement and contents
of its lower rooms. “We’ll git in aisy,”
he said; “wan o’ thim kitchin doors ain’t got
no bolt at all—nothin’ but a common
lock; an’ a wire’ll turn the kay an’ let us in as
aisy as the masther hissilf walks intil the front
door wid his latch-kay. An’ thin it’s all plain
sailin’; dinin’-room nixt, solid siller a plenty on
the sideboard; beyont that, jist acrost the hall’s
the lib’ry, where he kapes his money.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“But where he won’t kape it much longer,”
put in one of the others.</p>

<p class='c009' >“We’ll do oor indivors to relave him o’t the
noight, if that’s yer wull, captain,” continued
Teddy’s rough voice.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yis, if yees are all agraable. What’s yer
wull, Gotlieb? an’ yours, Pat?”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_7' id='Page_7'>7</a></span>
“I dinks we goes; and we petter makes
haste,” answered the first.</p>

<p class='c009' >Patrick echoed the sentiment, and they set
off at once, walking rapidly in a direction opposite
to that from which Phelim had come
some hours ago.</p>

<p class='c009' >They were armed with pistols and knives,
and carried with them a dark lantern and a full
set of burglars’ tools.</p>

<p class='c009' >When the family at Walnut Hill rose from
that night’s slumbers it was to find that butter,
bread, meat, and other edibles had disappeared
from spring-house and pantry; also all the silver
ware from the dining-room; and that the secretary
in the library had been robbed of several
hundred dollars in gold and silver, bank-notes,
and United States bonds.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER II.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008' >It was near sunset of a lovely June day. An
hour earlier Dr. Jasper had invited his wife
to drive with him a few miles into the country,
whither professional duties summoned him.
These had been attended to, and they were
travelling toward their home in Prairieville
again.</p>

<p class='c009' >Their way lay along the bank of the river,
which in this part of its course moved with
majestic quiet, reflecting in its clear depths the
beautiful blue of the sky overhead, the glories
of the sunset clouds, and the overshadowing
trees on the hither shore. On the opposite
bank a stretch of white sand, a few feet in width,
bordered green fields and meadows, beyond
which rose richly wooded hills.</p>

<p class='c009' >“It is a beautiful country,” remarked Mrs.
Jasper, in her soft, girlish tones. “But where
now?” as horse and gig took a sudden turn in
a westerly direction; “this is not the direct
route home.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“To Lakeside, my dear,” replied her husband.</p>

<p class='c009' >“That is where the Heaths reside, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes; and a very attractive place it is; I
want you to see it.”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_9' id='Page_9'>9</a></span>
“But, doctor, Miss Heath has not called
upon me.”</p>

<p class='c009' >He gave her a half-reproachful, half-humorous
look. “So I am your doctor? nothing
nearer or dearer, eh, Serena?” he said, dropping
the reins on his horse’s neck and bending
down to look into her eyes—large, soft, dark-brown
orbs shaded by heavy silken lashes.</p>

<p class='c009' >She was a handsome brunette, and so youthful
in appearance that few would have taken
her to be the mother of the three-year-old boy
seated on a stool between them.</p>

<p class='c009' >“You is my new papa, and me ’ikes you,”
remarked that young gentleman, rising hastily
to his feet, with the evident intention of bestowing
a hug upon the person addressed.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Sit still, Perry; you’ll fall out of the gig
and be killed,” said his mother, putting a hand
on his shoulder and forcing him down again.
“Alonzo, do make him behave.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“He’s going to do that of his own free will,”
replied the doctor, smiling down upon the little
prattler. “You know you must keep quiet,
my little man, if you want to ride with your
mamma and me.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Miss Heath has not called upon me yet,
Alonzo,” repeated Serena, “and it is not according
to the rules of etiquette for me to go
there before she does.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Ah, no matter for that, my love, since her
failure to do so has not been for want of will,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_10' id='Page_10'>10</a></span>
but of ability; and to please me and poor
Ronald, you will consent to waive ceremony in
this instance, I am sure.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“How want of ability?” she asked, with a
slight pout of the full red lips; “what has there
been to prevent her? ’Tis over a week since
we came to Prairieville, and the weather has
been charming.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes, I know; but Miriam Heath’s life is a
very busy one; she is a girl in a thousand.
Why, my dear, since her mother’s death, two
years ago, she has actually carried on the farming
herself; and she is only twenty-one, scarce
a year older than her brave soldier brother.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“A woman farmer! odious! She must be a
coarse, vulgar creature. How can you want
me to visit her, Alonzo?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“My dear Serena, you were never more mistaken,”
he said, warmly. “Miss Heath is as
refined and ladylike as any woman of my acquaintance.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“That doesn’t seem possible if she works in
the field like a man.”</p>

<p class='c009' >He smiled. “It is the head work she does—overseeing
and directing—while the actual hard
labor, ploughing, sowing, reaping, foddering
the cattle, and so forth, is done by hired men.”</p>

<p class='c009' >We will put in a few words the story of the
Heath family, which the doctor proceeded to
tell his wife.</p>

<p class='c009' >The parents of Miriam and Ronald were persons
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_11' id='Page_11'>11</a></span>
of education and refinement, native-born
Americans, who shortly after their marriage
had sought a home in this Northwestern State,
locating themselves on the banks of one of those
pretty little lakes so common in that region of
country, and within a mile of the village of
Prairieville.</p>

<p class='c009' >When the War of the Rebellion broke out
Mr. Heath was one of the first to volunteer for
the defence of the imperilled Union, while his
wife, equally full of patriotic zeal, undertook to
fill his place at home in overseeing and directing
operations upon their farm.</p>

<p class='c009' >In this she proved herself most efficient and
capable; fields, orchard, and garden flourished
under her sway, cattle increased in numbers
and grew sleek and fat.</p>

<p class='c009' >In the second year of the war her husband
came home sick and wounded, to die in her
arms. His eldest son, a lad of eighteen, then
enlisted in the Union army, and when, a few
months later, Mrs. Heath followed her husband
to the grave, Miriam assumed the whole burden
laid down by her mother—the superintendence
of the farm, and, with the assistance of her
grandmother, the care of the house and of a little
brother and sister many years younger than
herself and Ronald.</p>

<p class='c009' >Serena listened to the tale with interest about
equally divided between it and the beauties of
the landscape.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_12' id='Page_12'>12</a></span>
For the first quarter of a mile the road made
a gradual ascent; then the home of the Heaths
came into view—a comfortable and tasteful
dwelling, on the hither side of the pretty sheet
of water from which it took its name. A grove
of forest trees half hid the house from sight as
they approached, but passing that, vine-wreathed
porches, lawn, and flower-garden in the foreground,
and the rippling, sparkling waters of the
lake beyond, added their attractions to the scene.</p>

<p class='c009' >Serena uttered an exclamation of delight.
“Why, it’s a sort of paradise!”</p>

<p class='c009' >“A very fine situation,” responded the doctor;
“high and healthful. Look off yonder,
my dear; there lies Prairieville, apparently
almost at our feet. They have a fine view of it
from the front porch.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“And that side porch overlooks the lake?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes. The sitting-room opens upon it, and
at this hour we are likely to find the family
gathered there.”</p>

<p class='c009' >They were there at that moment; the early
tea had been partaken of and cleared away, and
the grandmother with her knitting and Miriam
with her sewing had seated themselves near the
hammock in which Ronald, pale-faced and thin,
and with his left arm in a sling, swung slowly
to and fro. The two little folks were present
also; Olive turning over the leaves of a picture-book,
Bertie, a little apart from the others, trying
to teach his dog Frisk a new trick.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_13' id='Page_13'>13</a></span>
Ronald was a dark-eyed, handsome youth,
but just now haggard and worn; hardly more
than the ghost of himself, as Miriam had said
again and again in tremulous tones and with
eyes full of tears since, less than a fortnight
ago, he had come home to her to be nursed
back—if such were the will of Providence—to
the health and strength of which wounds and
months of languishing in rebel prisons had deprived
him.</p>

<p class='c009' >His return was matter of great rejoicing to
each member of the household, yet their joy
was tempered with many a pang at thought of
his sufferings, past and present, and of the dear
parents who would return no more.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Grandma and Mirry,” he said, breaking a
silence which had fallen upon them for a few
moments, “this is paradise. What a luxury to
breathe this pure, sweet air; to gaze on your
flower-garden there, so full of beauty and
sweetness; the green grass, the waving trees,
and the lake beyond! How its waters sparkle
in the light of the setting sun!”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes, we have a lovely and delightful home
here,” responded his grandmother.</p>

<p class='c009' >“And you are one of those who appreciate
their mercies, Ronald,” Miriam added, with
tender look and tone.</p>

<p class='c009' >“I doubt if I am an unusually thankful person,”
he said, glancing around at her with a patient
smile; “but no one who has spent weeks
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_14' id='Page_14'>14</a></span>
and months shut up in a squalid, filthy prison,
devoured by vermin and fed upon food a dog
would turn from, could help enjoying such a
change as this.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Tell us some more ’bout it, Brother Ronald,”
pleaded a child’s voice at his other side.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Ah, are you there, Bertie?” queried Ronald,
turning his head to look at the speaker.
“I thought you were playing with your dog.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I was, but he’s run off, and now I’d like a
story.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Well, what is it you want to hear?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Everything.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Not all at once?” questioned Ronald, with
amusement, stroking the child’s head with his
pale hand. “But something you shall hear,
now while we are all together,” he added. “I
will tell you about the battle fought close to the
house where Mrs. Jasper and her father and
mother lived; though she was not Mrs. Jasper
then, but Mrs. Golding, a very young, very
pretty widow with one child, a little boy.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Was that where you got shooted?” asked
Bertie.</p>

<p class='c009' >“That was the time and place where and
when I received a wound that nearly cost me
my life, and I shall never forget the doctor’s
kindness to me or the motherly care of the old
lady; no, nor how good her daughter was to
me and the other poor fellows. I don’t wonder
Dr. Jasper fell in love with her.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_15' id='Page_15'>15</a></span>
“I want you two to become acquainted,” he
added, addressing Miriam; “you are both so
handsome and so nice, though as unlike as possible
in character and in looks, that I think you
can’t help liking each other very much indeed.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes; perhaps we shall fancy each other all
the more for our lack of resemblance,” responded
Miriam, with a quiet smile. “Suppose you
describe her to us.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I will. Instead of your fair skin and dark
blue eyes, she has brown eyes and a brunette
complexion. You are quick and sprightly in
your movements and your talk and are full of
energy. She hasn’t a bit of that, but talks and
moves with a sort of languishing grace that is
charming in her, but would not suit me in my
sister. I am very proud of you, Miriam, and
would not have you changed from what you are
in any respect,” he added, regarding her with
eyes that were full of fraternal pride and affection.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Nor I you,” she returned, tenderly pressing
his hand, which she had taken in hers;
“you can hardly feel so proud of me as I do of
my brave soldier-brother, who has fought and
bled for his country. What have I ever done in
comparison with that?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Somebody’s coming! I hear wheels!”
exclaimed Bertie. “Yes, there’s Dr. Jasper’s
gig right at the gate; and he’s helping a lady
out; and there’s a little boy, too.”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_16' id='Page_16'>16</a></span>
Miriam laid aside her sewing, and hurried out
to meet and welcome her guests.</p>

<p class='c009' >The doctor introduced his wife, explaining
that he had persuaded her to disregard the rules
of etiquette and make the first call.</p>

<p class='c009' >“I assure you I appreciate your kindness,
Mrs. Jasper,” Miriam said, with a warm grasp
of the little gloved hand, and an admiring look
into the brown eyes of the pretty ex-widow;
“and Ronald will be delighted; he has just
been telling us of all your and your mother’s
goodness to him;—yours, too, doctor.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Her voice trembled and her eyes filled.</p>

<p class='c009' >“It wasn’t much I could do,” Serena said,
in her soft, languishing tones, “and though I
was the biggest kind of a rebel, I couldn’t for
the life of me help liking him; and so, just for
his sake, you see, I yielded to the doctor’s entreaties
to come without waiting till you had
called upon me,” she added, saucily. “So
won’t you please take me to him?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes; he is just here on the porch, and will
be delighted to see you,” Miriam answered,
leading the way.</p>

<p class='c009' >Ronald would have risen to greet them, but
both the doctor and Serena bade him lie still,
for he was almost too weak for any other than
a reclining posture.</p>

<p class='c009' >The Jaspers were scarcely seated when there
was another arrival in the person of a young,
fine-looking man of gallant bearing, whom the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_17' id='Page_17'>17</a></span>
doctor and Ronald greeted most heartily as
“Warren,” and introduced to Mrs. Heath and
Miriam as Captain Charlton.</p>

<p class='c009' >He was evidently no stranger to Serena and
her boy, the latter of whom speedily claimed a
seat upon his knee.</p>

<p class='c009' >Through Ronald, Miriam and Charlton had
heard much of each other, and the captain had
long felt a strong desire to meet the sister of
whom his young friend always spoke with great
brotherly pride and affection. He had expected
to be disappointed in her, but he was not;
he found something in her appearance, her
manner, her conversation, that was irresistibly
charming.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008' >The Jaspers made only a short call, but when
they had gone the captain still lingered,
caressing little Olive, whom he had coaxed to
the seat upon his knee vacated by Perry Golding,
talking gayly with Ronald about some of
the lighter experiences of their army life—for
they had been companions in arms—yet furtively
watching Miriam and frequently addressing
a remark to her.</p>

<p class='c009' >“That will be a match, you may depend
upon it, Alonzo,” Serena said to her husband,
with a wise nod of her pretty head as they
drove homeward.</p>

<p class='c009' >“What will be a match, my dear?” he asked,
giving her a roguish look and smile.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Now, you needn’t pretend that you don’t
understand me,” she said; “you know very
well what I mean. Captain Charlton is smitten
with that handsome Miss Heath, and I saw in a
minute that they were made for each other.”</p>

<p class='c009' >At that moment a horseman came dashing up
at a gallop, bowing and lifting his hat as he passed.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Colonel Bangs,” murmured Serena. “Alonzo,
I perfectly detest that man.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“In which you are by no means peculiar,”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_19' id='Page_19'>19</a></span>
replied the doctor; “overbearing and tyrannical
to the last degree, and strongly suspected
of cowardice in the face of the enemy, he was
cordially hated by many of his men.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Is he going to Lakeside, do you think?”</p>

<p class='c009' >The doctor put his head out of the gig and
glanced back at the house they had just left.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes,” he said, drawing it in again; “he has
reined in at the gate. I suspect the captain is
to have a rival.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“If it’s the colonel, I don’t think he need be
alarmed,” returned Serena. “What chance
has a homely, disagreeable old bachelor beside
a handsome, good-humored young fellow like
Captain Charlton?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Ah, but the colonel is said to be in very
easy circumstances; while Warren, poor fellow,
has next to nothing.”</p>

<p class='c009' >The colonel had now dismounted, fastened
his horse, and entered the gate. A middle-aged
Irishman, a rough but good-humored-looking
fellow, was at work at the flower-beds.
He had saluted the doctor and his wife courteously
as they passed him; the captain also;
but looking up at the sound of Bangs’s entrance,
and seeing who it was, he simply scowled and
turned to his work again.</p>

<p class='c009' >“What are you doing here, you—— rascal?”
demanded Bangs, in an insolent tone.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Mindin’ me own business, sor; an’ it’s yersilf
that had betther be doin’ that same, an’ not
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_20' id='Page_20'>20</a></span>
meddlin’ wid an honest man as yees haven’t got
no authority over no longer.”</p>

<p class='c009' >A lightning glance of intense scorn, contempt,
and hatred, accompanied by a volley of oaths
and curses, not loud but deep; and with that
Bangs turned and hurried up the path and
around to the side porch, where the family and
Captain Charlton were sitting. He was greeted
politely, and invited to take a seat among
them; but his arrival seemed to act as a damper
upon the whole party; conversation flagged,
and presently there was dead silence for a moment.
It was broken by Bangs.</p>

<p class='c009' >“This is a lovely spot,” he remarked, sending
a sweeping glance around. “I would advise
you to have a care whom you employ.
These fellows who have been in the army during
the war”—and he nodded in the direction of
the front garden—“are apt to be lawless, and
too ready to help themselves to whatever they
can lay their hands on. Got in the way of it,
you know, plundering the rebs.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I must say, sir, that I consider your remark
grossly unjust to our brave boys in blue,” said
Captain Charlton, his cheek reddening and his
eye flashing; “for though there could not fail
to be many bad fellows among the immense
numbers in the field, the large majority were
loyal, true, and honest, and have gone back to
civil life to gain an honest living at their old
employments.”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_21' id='Page_21'>21</a></span>
“Yes; and it is so with Barney Nolan,
against whom you seem to be warning us,
Colonel Bangs,” Miriam said, with spirit.
“Norah, his wife, who has been our charwoman
for years past, tells me he is leading a
sober, industrious life, treating her and his children
kindly, and doing his best to provide for
them.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Humph! What kind of character did he
bear before he went into the army?” sneered
Bangs.</p>

<p class='c009' >“He drank a good deal; but army life, it
seems, has reformed and improved him. A
rather unusual effect, doubtless,” Miriam concluded,
with a mischievous twinkle of the eye
and a meaning look at her antagonist.</p>

<p class='c009' >And now Mrs. Heath, the gentle old grandmother,
desirous to pour oil upon the troubled
waters, put in her soothing word.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes, Barney is behaving very well indeed;
and he and Norah are as faithful workers as one
could ask for. And I think all the people about
here are honest. I’ve never heard of a burglary
anywhere in this region of country.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“You haven’t? Well, I can tell you there
was a daring and successful one last night at
Walnut Hill, Judge Hall’s place, which, you
know, is not many miles up the valley,” returned
Bangs, with evident triumph.</p>

<p class='c009' >The ladies were much startled; Ronald
looked troubled and anxious; but Captain
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_22' id='Page_22'>22</a></span>
Charlton received the news quietly, remarking
that he had heard it some hours since, but
thought it not worth while to annoy these
friends with the story, as it could only rouse
their apprehensions without doing any good.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Have they been caught?” asked the old lady.</p>

<p class='c009' >“The burglars?” queried Bangs, with a
malicious smile. “No, madam; not yet.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Then he went on to describe the premises
visited by Phelim O’Rourke and his confederates,
and the valuables they had carried off.
He seemed to take pleasure in enlarging upon
the ease with which they had effected an entrance,
and the fact that they were men evidently
accomplished in the art of housebreaking
and lock-picking.</p>

<p class='c009' >Charlton made a movement to go; but an
entreating look and word from Ronald led him
to resume his seat, and he outstayed the colonel.</p>

<p class='c009' >When the latter had gone, “What has he
against Barney Nolan?” asked the old lady.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Barney belonged to his regiment,” replied
Ronald, “and had to submit to many an act of
outrageous tyranny from him.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“That would account for Barney’s disliking
him,” she said, doubtfully.</p>

<p class='c009' >“And for his dislike to Barney,” added
Charlton. “A man hates those he oppresses.
Besides, it is quite likely the Irishman has retorted
with his tongue, if in no other way, as
who would not?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008' >The robbery at Walnut Hill caused a good
deal of excitement in Prairieville and for
miles up and down Wild River Valley, but no
clew to the perpetrators could be discovered.</p>

<p class='c009' >O’Rourke and his confederates scattered
themselves about for the time, seeking work
here and there among the farmers, with whom
it was a busy season, behaved through the day
like industrious working-men who had no
thought of anything but earning an honest
living by the sweat of their brows; and if they
met at night while others slept, to hatch their
schemes of villainy, it was always in some lonely
and unfrequented spot—the depths of a forest,
a cave among the hills, or by the river-side,
far from any dwelling. Thus cunningly they
continued to elude suspicion for weeks and
months, till at length it began to be said that
the burglars must have been strangers to the
community, who had committed the one act and
then fled from the vicinity.</p>

<p class='c009' >But when the harvest was garnered, and
some farmers, having sold their wheat, were
popularly supposed to have money in their
houses, these were entered and rifled night after
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_24' id='Page_24'>24</a></span>
night—now here, now there, at places miles
apart; now near Prairieville, now five, ten, or
fifteen miles away, either up or down the valley;
and anon, the villains, emboldened by
success in eluding justice, ventured occasionally
even to enter the town and rob stores and
dwellings where they had any reason to expect
to find rich booty.</p>

<p class='c009' >Excitement and indignation grew apace as it
became evident to all that the valley was infested
by an organized band of desperadoes.</p>

<p class='c009' >Bangs, who was a prominent lawyer in Prairieville,
very generally feared and disliked,
tried again and again to fix suspicion upon Barney
Nolan as one of the gang, but without success,
as Nolan was liked in the community, being
entirely inoffensive, good-tempered, and industrious.</p>

<p class='c009' >Though a bachelor, Lawyer Bangs owned
and lived in one of the finest dwelling-houses in
the town. He had it very handsomely furnished,
too, especially his parlor, bedroom, and
private office.</p>

<p class='c009' >His sister, Mrs. Wiley, kept house for him,
and ruled with a high hand over her husband,
an orphan niece, who was so unfortunate as to
have no other home, and the maid of all work;
the last named, however, being treated far more
leniently than the other two, because she might
go away if too hardly dealt with.</p>

<p class='c009' >Mrs. Wiley dressed richly and sometimes
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_25' id='Page_25'>25</a></span>
wore expensive jewelry. Lawyer Bangs liked
a display of solid silver on his table; he was
said to have brought home a quantity of it
when he returned from the war; how procured
was best known to himself; so that there was
probably more to tempt burglars in that house
than in any other private dwelling of the town,
and it stood upon the outskirts, apparently more
unprotected than most; yet, strange to say, it
was not entered. Phelim O’Rourke, it would
seem, had neglected to pay it a nocturnal visit,
but he had been there frequently in broad daylight,
closeted for an hour or more with the
lawyer in his office.</p>

<p class='c009' >But Phelim’s name had not been connected
with the burglaries; and no one denounced the
scoundrels more loudly and indignantly than
Bangs—or the colonel, as he preferred to be
called, though he had resigned his commission
with the close of the war.</p>

<p class='c009' >Both he and Captain Charlton had been during
all these weeks very frequent visitors at
Lakeside. The latter had become a great favorite
with all the family; his coming was ever
hailed with delight by Ronald and the little
ones; the grandmother invariably welcomed
him with a smile and cordial grasp of the hand;
and though Miriam’s greeting was somewhat
more formal and distant, the brightening of
her eye at his approach and the slight deepening
of the rose on her cheek did not betoken
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_26' id='Page_26'>26</a></span>
dislike or even indifference to her brother’s
friend.</p>

<p class='c009' >Bangs, on the other hand, could not but perceive
that his visits were barely tolerated. The
children shunned him, and Miriam did the same
whenever she could without absolute rudeness.</p>

<p class='c009' >It fired him with resentment and hatred toward
Charlton, whom he looked upon as a
favored rival, and filled him with a dogged
determination to win the girl by fair means or
by foul; she should marry him—willingly, if
she would; but her hand he would have,
whether her heart went with it or not.</p>

<p class='c009' >Having come to this determination, he forthwith
set his wits to work to find means to accomplish
his end.</p>

<p class='c009' >“If I could get a hold upon the property,”
he said to himself, “that would be the likeliest
thing to bring her around. She’s attached to
the place; still more to that crippled brother
and the little ones, and would sooner sacrifice
herself than see them come to want. Yes, that
will be my very best chance. I wonder if they
have the farm quite clear of incumbrance, and if
the title is without a flaw? I must find out.”</p>

<p class='c009' >It was one evening, while on his way home
from a very unsatisfactory call at Lakeside, that
Bangs held this conversation with himself. He
had that day engaged a man to attend to his
horse, and as he rode up to his stable the fellow
stepped out and took the bridle.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_27' id='Page_27'>27</a></span>
Bangs alighted, and saying, “Rub her down
well, O’Rourke, and give her a good feed of
oats when she has cooled off,” he walked into
the house.</p>

<p class='c009' >The sound of repeated vigorous blows, mingled
with sobs and cries of pain, fright and
entreaty in a shrill female voice, “Oh, Aunt
Dora, I will be good! I will be good!” met
his ear as he entered.</p>

<p class='c009' >“What’s all this about?” he growled,
throwing open the door of the sitting-room,
where a short, stout, broad-faced woman was
belaboring with a rattan a thin, pale, under-grown
girl of fourteen, who, held fast in the
strong grasp of her tormentor, was vainly
struggling to get free, and as vainly endeavoring
to dodge the furious storm of blows rapidly
descending upon her shoulders and arms.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Oh, Uncle Avery, save me! she’s killing
me!” shrieked the girl.</p>

<p class='c009' >“No interference; she richly deserves all
she’s getting!” exclaimed the operator between
her set teeth, and turning on him a pair
of light blue eyes, glittering with passion, as he
strode across the room toward herself and the
victim of her rage.</p>

<p class='c009' >“What has she done now?” he demanded.
“You wear yourself out in beating her, Dora;
and I don’t see that she’s a whit the better for
it. Come, come; whatever she’s done she’s had
enough for this time, and I want to talk with you.”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_28' id='Page_28'>28</a></span>
At that Mrs. Wiley released the girl, who
threw herself, trembling and sobbing, on a
lounge.</p>

<p class='c009' >Bangs glanced at her half pityingly, half contemptuously;
then turning to his sister, “Were
you going out?” he asked. “I see you have
on your bonnet and shawl.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“No; I’ve just come home from church;
where, by the way, you ought to have been
with me.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Not I, indeed,” he returned, sneeringly.
“I have no religious character to keep up;
never made any pretensions in that line; one
saint in the family is sufficient—especially of the
kind I’m most familiar with.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I fully understand your insinuations,” she
said, her eyes flashing with anger; “but I
shall do my duty by Mary, nevertheless. I
must help her to conquer that dreadful temper
of hers.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“‘Example is better than precept,’” he
quoted, significantly; “but what particular
exhibition of temper had she given to entitle
her to so thorough a flogging?—a punishment,
by the way, rather unsuited, in my humble
opinion, to a girl of her years.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“It’s the only thing that has any effect,”
Mrs. Wiley asserted, with decision. “I reproved
her for mislaying her gloves (she had
laid them on the table in the parlor instead of
carrying them up to her room and putting them
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_29' id='Page_29'>29</a></span>
in their proper place), and you should have
seen the scowl she gave me when I spoke to
her about it.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Well, well, enough said, Dora; though it
strikes me that if I professed to be a saint, and
had just come home from church, I’d feel called
upon to exercise some patience with the faults
and follies of youth. But come into my private
office, for, as I said, I want a little talk with
you on a matter of business.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Having led the way, and seen her dumpy figure
comfortably ensconced in the large, leather-cushioned
arm-chair, which usually held his
own spare person, he opened the conference
with an abrupt query.</p>

<p class='c009' >“You are intimately acquainted at Lakeside,
are you not? and esteemed there as a burning
and shining light in the church?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“How should I know whether they think me
that or not?” she asked, reddening and tossing
her head.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Well, answer to the best of your knowledge.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“We’ve not visited much; but only because
we lived so far apart, and are all busy with our
own affairs and church work. They know I’m
always active in those things; and I presume
they have every confidence in my piety—as
most people have who know me.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“But not too well—eh, Dora?” he supplemented,
with a sneer.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_30' id='Page_30'>30</a></span>
“Avery, if you have nothing but insults for
me, I’ll go back to my own part of the house,”
she said, rising with dignity, while her face
flushed hotly and her eyes sparkled with anger.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Nonsense! we understand each other,
Dora,” he returned, with an unpleasant laugh,
as he pushed her back into her seat—not roughly.
“Stay and hear me out. I think you’ll
find it to your advantage to do that and something
besides, which I am going to propose.”</p>

<p class='c009' >She yielded, though ungraciously and with a
frowning face.</p>

<p class='c009' >He told her of his purpose to wed Miriam
Heath, and the small encouragement he had to
hope she would ever become his bride of her
own free will.</p>

<p class='c009' >Mrs. Wiley’s face grew darker as he proceeded.
“Why do you seek her, then?” she asked
in impatience. “She is no such prize that—”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Pardon me, madam, if I venture to differ
from you there,” he interrupted, drawing himself
up with a haughty air. “Miriam Heath is
an uncommonly fine girl in both looks and character.
Where, let me ask, could you find another
who could and would do what she has
done—carry on a farm and support a family in
comfort?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I don’t see what you want to marry for;
you are much better off as you are,” remarked
his sister, ignoring his query.</p>

<p class='c009' >“There, again, your opinion and mine fail to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_31' id='Page_31'>31</a></span>
coincide. I tell you, I am determined to make
Miriam Heath my wife—willingly, if possible;
otherwise unwillingly.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I don’t see how you can force her into it.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I think I do; and I want your help in carrying
out my scheme.” He then unfolded his
plans, and told her her part must be to cultivate
the acquaintance of the family, and when
an opportunity offered to worm out of Mrs.
Heath the desired information. “Remember,
she is the one,” he said in conclusion; “the
girl and Ronald would be too sharp to give it;
the children are too young to know anything
about such matters; but the old lady, of course,
knows everything; and she is very simple-hearted,
frank, and doubtless has entire confidence
in you.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Mrs. Wiley demurred; was not sure it would
be quite right to do what he wished—so she
said; but the truth of the matter was that she
did not want him to marry; for should he remain
single, and she outlive him, she would be
his natural heir.</p>

<p class='c009' >He read her motives, and set them aside by
remarking that if he could get the desired hold
upon Miriam, and she refuse in spite of all to
give him her hand, he would add Lakeside to
his property.</p>

<p class='c009' >The pale blue eyes opposite him brightened
visibly. “And we might move out there,” she
observed, with ill-concealed eagerness. “It’s a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_32' id='Page_32'>32</a></span>
lovely place. I have always thought the Heaths
very fortunate in owning it. Well, Avery,
every one must look after his own interests.
I’ll do as you wish.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“That’s right, Dora,” he returned with satisfaction;
“but let me caution you not to broach
the subject too soon, lest the old lady should
think you prying and be put upon her guard.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“You may trust me to play my cards skilfully,”
she returned, bridling.</p>

<p class='c009' >“And not to let the grass grow under your
feet? Love is impatient, you know.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Greed also,” she added, with a malicious
smile. “No; there shall be no unnecessary
delay. Lend me Phelim and the horse and
buggy to-morrow, and I’ll drive over and open
proceedings by making a call.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“They are all at your service whenever
wanted for that purpose. You’ll do, Dora.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Mrs. Wiley drove over to Lakeside the next
afternoon. It was a bleak November day, and
as she alighted at the gate Phelim growled out
a protest against “bein’ left to sit waitin’ out
here in the cowld.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Keep yourself warm by exercise,” she said,
sharply. “You can fasten the horse, and pace
back and forth in the path along the fence side
there.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Bertie opened the door in answer to her ring,
and ushered her into the sitting-room, where
Ronald, reclining in a large arm-chair, was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_33' id='Page_33'>33</a></span>
reading aloud to his grandmother, who sat
placidly knitting by his side. Miriam was not
at home, as Mrs. Wiley knew, having passed
her in the town.</p>

<p class='c009' >The old lady rose with a polite greeting to
the visitor, while Bertie set a chair for her,
then returned to his play—helping Olive to
build block houses in a corner of the room.</p>

<p class='c009' >Mrs. Wiley was very sweet and condescending
(how Ronald detested her for that last!),
made a few commonplace remarks on the
weather and the crops, then condoled with the
lad on his protracted sufferings, and with Mrs.
Heath because of the care that devolved upon
her in the rearing of her grandchildren.</p>

<p class='c009' >“I know how to sympathize with you,” she
sighed, “having burdened myself with the
bringing up of an orphan niece. It is a great
responsibility. I feel that she can never repay
me for all I am doing for her; but I look to
the Lord for my reward.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“And I am sure, if you are doing it for His
sake, He will not leave you unrewarded,” returned
the old lady, her eyes glistening. “But,
indeed, I cannot rate so highly my poor services
to my son’s children, and shall feel amply
recompensed if they grow up to be good and
useful members of society. In fact, Mrs.
Wiley, they repay me now by their dutiful and
affectionate behavior.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Oh, grandma, you put too low an estimate
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_34' id='Page_34'>34</a></span>
upon your good deeds!” remarked Ronald, half
playfully, half tenderly.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Child, I have never done any worth the
name,” she returned, with unaffected humility.</p>

<p class='c009' >Mrs. Wiley changed the subject. Turning
to Ronald, she spoke in glowing terms of the
debt of gratitude owed by the country to her
“brave boys in blue,” the noble fellows who
had fought and bled to save the Union (she
must say it, even though her dear brother
Avery was one of them), and she would try to
do a little toward cancelling her own share of
the obligation to Ronald by sending over some
little delicacy now and then to tempt his sickly
appetite; she was reckoned a good cook—she
did not say it boastingly—though, of course,
not better than his own grandmother and sister;
but something sent in from a neighbor’s was
appreciated by an invalid just because it came
from abroad.</p>

<p class='c009' >Ronald thanked her, not too warmly, and
added that he could not have her put herself to
so much trouble; his appetite was not bad, and
home cooking really suited him better than any
other.</p>

<p class='c009' >At that her cheek flushed, and for an instant
she looked ill pleased; then laughing lightly,
she remarked that no one ought to blame him
for his partiality to those who were so very
near and dear. Yet, as it was often desirable
and beneficial to vary the diet, she would venture
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_35' id='Page_35'>35</a></span>
to do as she had proposed. It would be
no trouble at all; on the contrary, a real pleasure,
for she loved to do good and to give.</p>

<p class='c009' >“But we of this family are not in need, madam,”
he returned, his tone slightly sarcastic,
“and your alms were better bestowed upon
those who are.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Oh, fie! you must not be so proud,” she
said, adopting a sportive tone, though evidently
with an effort. “You are a reader, I see,” she
added, glancing at the book he had laid aside
on her entrance. “I hope you don’t neglect
your Bible?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“No, he does not,” said his grandmother,
answering for him; “Ronald is a good boy.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I rejoice to hear it,” was the gracious rejoinder,
“and I shall do myself the pleasure of
bringing him some good books, of which I keep
a supply constantly on hand on purpose to lend
or give where I think they may prove useful.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Ronald could not bring himself to thank her;
but his grandmother did it for him, and with a
parting nod and smile, and an injunction to
him to take care of himself and get well as fast
as possible, the visitor took her departure.</p>

<p class='c009' >“What a good woman she is!” Mrs. Heath
said, coming back from seeing her off. “What
an earnest, faithful, working Christian! always
at the prayer-meeting, she tells me; always
engaged heart and soul in some good work. I
wish I were more like her,” and she sighed involuntarily
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_36' id='Page_36'>36</a></span>
as she resumed her knitting and her
rocker by the side of her boy.</p>

<p class='c009' >“And I do not, grandma,” he returned, with
warmth; “you would not be half so dear and
lovable as you are.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“My dear boy, how can you say it?” she
asked, in mild surprise.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Grandma, doesn’t the Bible say it is not he
that commendeth himself who is approved, but
whom the Lord commendeth? And why does
that woman put on such airs of condescension
toward you? She is not your superior in any
respect; no, nor half your equal in very many.”</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER V.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008' >A little crowd, mostly men, were gathered
about the depot door to watch the
arrival of the westward-bound evening train.
A few yards farther from the track, Miriam
Heath, seated in a buggy, had reined in her
horse and was quietly waiting. At the first
sound of the whistle, instantly followed by
the rush and roar of the train, the animal
started aside, snorting, and rolling his eyes
wildly.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Shall I take his head, miss?” asked a voice
in a rich Irish brogue, and Phelim O’Rourke,
hurrying from Bangs’s stable to join the waiting
throng, sprang hastily forward and seized
the bridle-rein.</p>

<p class='c009' >“No; I can hold him; he will be quiet
enough as soon as he sees what it is,” Miriam
answered shortly, not overpleased at the officiousness
of the man.</p>

<p class='c009' >He stepped away a few paces and regarded
her with a malignant scowl.</p>

<p class='c009' >Her words were made good almost before
they had left her lips. The train swept into
sight, and her horse stood quiet as a lamb, while
the engine puffed, snorted, and blew off steam,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_38' id='Page_38'>38</a></span>
and the passengers poured out and scattered
themselves hither and thither.</p>

<p class='c009' >A middle-aged man, with a sober, honest
Scotch face, in decent farmer dress, and carrying
a satchel in his hand, was among the first to
alight.</p>

<p class='c009' >“You’re a gude leddy, as weel’s a bonny ane,
Miss Miriam,” he said, hurrying toward her.
“I’m no ill pleased to forego the pleasure o’ a
tramp through the cauld and ower the frozen,
rough roads.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I thought you would come back tired,
Sandy,” she returned, resigning the reins to
him as he took the seat by her side, having already
bestowed his satchel in the bottom of the
buggy. “Besides, it will be safer, in case—”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Wait a wee, Miss Miriam,” he interrupted,
in an undertone. “Along wi’ ye! lively now,
Robin!” to the horse, who at once set off at a
brisk trot in the direction of home.</p>

<p class='c009' >O’Rourke had watched the little scene with a
sort of covert eagerness, and as the buggy
whirled away up the road his eyes followed it
with a look of lurking triumph and greed.</p>

<p class='c009' >Neither of its occupants spoke again till quite
clear of the town. Then, having first sent a
cautious glance from side to side, Sandy, again
speaking in a low key, as if fearful of being
overheard, said: “It’s gude news I bring ye,
Miss Miriam; by the blessing o’ Providence
the wheat sold uncommon weel, and they paid
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_39' id='Page_39'>39</a></span>
doon; so that I hae a matter o’ $1500 for ye—a
trifle o’ odd dollars ower that.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Oh, Sandy, that is good!” she cried, joyously.
“But I wish it were safe in the bank.
If we could only have got it here in time!”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Three hours sooner. I wish it could have
been done, Miss Miriam. But we’ll try to tak’
care o’t the night, and deposit it betimes i’ the
morn.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Oh, if we only can, Sandy! Just think;
we shall be able at once to pay off the interest
on the mortgage and half the principal; and
another such year will give us the place entirely
free from incumbrance,” she said, her eyes
shining.</p>

<p class='c009' >Sandy McAllister was her right-hand man on
the farm, working with steady industry for
day’s wages; her true and trusted friend as
well, knowing her affairs almost as intimately
as she did herself, and taking a fatherly interest
in her success and the prosperity of the whole
family.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes; what’s ower and abune will be sufficient,
wi’ what the potatoes, and cabbage, and
a’ the ither crops o’ vegetables, and the fruits
will bring in, to keep the pot boilin’ till anither
harvest,” he remarked, reflectively. “Ye’ll
win through, Miss Miriam; there’s promises to
the widow and the fatherless, and the Lord’s
aye faithful to His word.”</p>

<p class='c009' >It was nearly dark when they reached Lakeside,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_40' id='Page_40'>40</a></span>
but there was light and warmth in its
cosey sitting-room, whither Miriam carried the
satchel, while Sandy drove around to the stable
and put up the horse.</p>

<p class='c009' >The grandmother was dishing up the supper,
Ronald keeping the little ones quiet with a
story; but on Miriam’s entrance they left him,
and ran to meet her with a shout of joy.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Oh, sister, we’re so glad you’ve come
home! We were ’fraid you’d got lost.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Were you?” she said, stooping to caress
them in turn.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes; we were beginning to be uneasy; it
was growing so dark,” said her grandmother,
filling the teapot and setting it on the table.
“Come now, dears, tea is ready.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I believe the train was a few minutes behind
time,” Miriam answered. “Grandmother,”
and putting an arm round the old lady’s
neck, she whispered in her ear something that
brought a pleased, thankful look into the placid
face.</p>

<p class='c009' >Then going to the side of Ronald’s easy-chair,
“The wheat sold well; so well that we shall
be able to pay the interest on the mortgage and
half the principal,” she said, in a low, joyous
tone, leaning over him, her eyes shining and
her cheeks dimpling with a glad smile.</p>

<p class='c009' >“That is good news indeed!” he cried, his
face reflecting the brightness of hers. “If we
continue to prosper so, we’ll have the place
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_41' id='Page_41'>41</a></span>
clear in another year; also, I trust I may be
able by that time to relieve you of at least a
part of the burden of supporting the family.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Ah, it takes two to make a bargain; and I
may not be willing to resign my sceptre,” she
answered, gayly, as she threw off bonnet and
shawl and took her seat with the rest at the
table.</p>

<p class='c009' >The meal was enlivened by cheerful chat,
though the same anxious thought pressed more
or less heavily upon the heart of each of the
elders of the party. No one gave it utterance
till the little ones were quiet in their nest; then,
with every door locked and bolted, every shutter
closed and barred, and the curtains drawn,
the four (Sandy being always taken into their
counsels) drew together and examined the contents
of the satchel.</p>

<p class='c009' >“A thousand-dollar bill!” Ronald said, turning
it about in his hands, “and marked with
some one’s initials. Well, if the burglars should
rob us of it they would hardly dare venture to
use it.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“True, sir,” said Sandy; “an’ what’s to
hinder us frae spoilin’ these ither anes for their
use in the same way? Here’s four one-hundred-dollar
notes, one fifty, and the rest in fives,
tens, and siller.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“A good idea,” assented Ronald. “Mirry,
please bring pen and ink.”</p>

<p class='c009' >The marking was done, and they were discussing
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_42' id='Page_42'>42</a></span>
the probabilities of a visit from the
burglars infesting the country, and the best disposition
to be made of the money for the night,
when a loud knocking at the kitchen door
startled them and set the hearts of the two
ladies to beating almost audibly. Sandy rose
to answer it, while Miriam hastily concealed
the notes in the bosom of her dress.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Mirry,” whispered Ronald, “give them up
rather than suffer yourself to be roughly handled.
Sandy, don’t open the door till you
know who is there.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Surely not, sir,” returned the man, as he
left the room, carefully closing the door behind
him.</p>

<p class='c009' >The others sat silent, straining their ears to
hear.</p>

<p class='c009' >Sandy held a moment’s parley with some
one; then the bolt was withdrawn, and the
tones of a female voice, speaking with a rich
Irish brogue, penetrated to the inner room.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Nora!” exclaimed Miriam, in a tone of relief.</p>

<p class='c009' >“A friend instead of an enemy, as we
feared,” added Mrs. Heath.</p>

<p class='c009' >They had full confidence in Nora’s honesty
and good will; scarcely less in those of Barney.</p>

<p class='c009' >“But she may come to warn us of danger,”
said Ronald, in a low tone of great anxiety.</p>

<p class='c009' >The others had not thought of that. But
Sandy was ushering Nora into the room.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Good avenin’ till yees, leddies an’ Misther
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_43' id='Page_43'>43</a></span>
Ronald, sor,” she said, dropping a courtesy;
“an’ I ax yer pardons fer throublin’ yees this
toime o’ noight; but it’s all along o’ Barney
an’ me a thinkin’ yees moight be a thrifle onaisy
in yer moinds, considerin’ there’s so manny
thaves about, an’ Misther McAllisther jist
home from the city, an’ maybe suspected o’
bringin’ money wid him, an’ the bank closed so
he couldn’t put it there for safe kapin’. An’
Barney”—she drew nearer, glanced cautiously
around, and lowered her voice to a loud whisper—“he
says, says he, ‘Nora, I’m onaisy
about Miss Miriam an’ the rest, for I see that
raskil Phalim O’Rourke a prowlin’ round while
I was cuttin’ wood in the back yarrud this
afthernoon. He’d brought Bangs’s sisther in
the buggy, an’ while she was intil the house
talkin’ wid the ould lady, he was makin’ hisself
acquainted wid the premisis. An’ I’ll be bound
it wasn’t fer no good, nayther.’”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Is he one of the burglars?” asked Miriam,
paling visibly.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Barney an’ me cudn’t jist say that same,
Miss Mirry; but it’s a thafe he was in the war;
an’ he’s makin’ his ould fayther an’ mither
moighty comfortable in a nice little house in
the town, that he’s bought an’ paid fer, an’ nobody
knows where the money come from; fer
how cud the spalpeen mak’ the loike o’ that
same workin’ round fer the farmers an’ takin’
care o’ Bangs’s horse?”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_44' id='Page_44'>44</a></span>
“It certainly looks suspicious,” said Ronald;
“but what is it you have to propose, Nora?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Jist this, sor; that if it’s agrayable till the
leddies an’ yersilf, and wull make yees anny
aisier in yer moinds, Barney’ll come an’ help
guard the house till to-morrow mornin’, an’
not lave at all at all till the sun’s up an’ shinin’.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“That is very kind,” said Miriam; “but
what would become of you and the children if
the burglars should take a fancy to pay you a
visit?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“An’ sure, miss, what would they be afther
in our poor bit of a hut?” laughed Nora.
“There ain’t nothin’ there to stale, barrin’ me
an’ the childer.”</p>

<p class='c009' >The kind proposal was acceded to with hearty
thanks. Nora, rejecting McAllister’s proffered
services as escort, hastened away, and in a few
minutes Barney presented himself in their midst.</p>

<p class='c009' >The intervening time had been employed by
them in disposing of the money for the night.
Ronald would have had it laid under his pillow; but
Miriam entered an indignant protest.</p>

<p class='c009' >“What,” she asked, “was the money worth
in comparison with his life? That should not
be risked by having the filthy lucre in the same
room with him.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“The money is worth a great deal as the
means of sustaining all our lives,” Ronald answered,
quietly; “but since you reject my
plan, what other have you to offer?”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_45' id='Page_45'>45</a></span>
“I will take the smaller notes and conceal
them upstairs. If they come and find the larger
ones, they will probably think that is all and
look no farther; so none of our lives will be
endangered, and the notes, being marked, may
be recovered.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes,” the grandmother said; “we will put
them in the parlor, and in not too unlikely a
place, lest they should come to our bedrooms
in search of them, and if we happen to wake,
kill us to keep us from telling of them, and so
bringing them to justice.”</p>

<p class='c009' >These suggestions were immediately carried
out. Miriam went into the parlor, without a
light, fearing that even a slight gleam might
furnish a clew to a lurking foe, put the bank-notes
into a little chimney cupboard, locked it,
and took away the key.</p>

<p class='c009' >They retired early, as was their custom.
Mrs. Heath, Miriam, and the two children
slept upstairs; but Ronald’s bedroom was on
the ground floor, opening into the sitting-room
where they had passed the evening.</p>

<p class='c009' >In this last Sandy and Barney took up their
quarters for the night, each armed with a loaded
revolver. It had been agreed that each
should take his turn in watching while the other
slept, and that upon any sound of approaching
footsteps, or an attempt of any one outside to
open window or door, the sleeper should be instantly
roused by his companion.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_46' id='Page_46'>46</a></span>
McAllister took the first watch, keeping himself
awake with a book. Shortly after one
o’clock he roused Barney, shaking him somewhat
roughly, and saying in an undertone,
“Come, me mon; it’s my turn the noo; and
richt glad I am, for I can scarce keep my een
open ony langer.”</p>

<p class='c009' >They exchanged places. Sandy began to
snore the moment he had stretched himself
upon the lounge from which Barney had just
risen; while the latter, weary with a hard day’s
work, and heavy with sleep, yawned in his
chair, shook himself, sat erect, and stretched
his eyes wide open with a determined air, then
rose and paced the room, but with a stealthy
tread, lest he should disturb Ronald.</p>

<p class='c009' >He meant to be faithful to his trust, had no
mind to be conquered by sleep, but fatigue
presently sent him back to his chair; half unconsciously
his head dropped upon the table,
his eyes closed, and in another moment he was
wrapped in profound slumber.</p>

<p class='c009' >The clock on the mantel struck two, but both
he and his fellow-watcher remained deaf to the
sound. The hands moved steadily on and
pointed to ten minutes of three, as something—he
did not know what—startled and awoke him.</p>

<p class='c009' >He sat up and listened. There was a slight
noise—where? in the parlor? Yes; as of some
one stepping cautiously across the floor.</p>

<p class='c009' >Barney sprang to his feet, dealt McAllister a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_47' id='Page_47'>47</a></span>
smart blow to rouse him, seized a pistol, threw
open the door into the hall, and rushed across
into the parlor.</p>

<p class='c009' >As he did so a man dashed past him to one of
the front windows, which was open, as Barney
at once perceived by the glimmer of light from
the snow outside and the draught of cold air.</p>

<p class='c009' >He sprang after the retreating figure and
grasped it about the waist as it gained the window-sill.</p>

<p class='c009' >But with a desperate effort, and a blow in the
face that felled Nolan to the floor, the burglar
freed himself, and springing lightly to the
ground, sped away like the wind.</p>

<p class='c009' >Barney was up in an instant and in hot pursuit,
crying at the top of his voice, “Stop
thafe! stop thafe!”</p>

<p class='c009' >Sandy, too, taking a flying leap through the
window, joined in the race, echoing the cry
with all the strength of his lungs, but with the
Scotch accent instead of the Irish brogue.</p>

<p class='c009' >But the burglar, being younger and fleeter of
foot than they, and having the start of them,
soon distanced their pursuit; and uncertain
which direction he had taken, and bethinking
themselves of the defenceless state of those left
behind at Lakeside, should accomplices of the
fleeing scoundrel be lingering about, they made
haste to return.</p>

<p class='c009' >They found Ronald and the ladies awake and
in great anxiety and alarm.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_48' id='Page_48'>48</a></span>
An examination of the parlor at once disclosed
the fact that the cupboard door had been
opened with a skeleton key and the money
taken. Its loss was a great blow to the family,
yet the fact that the notes were marked gave
them some hope of their final recovery.</p>

<p class='c009' >“I dinna see ony evidence that the mon had
accomplices,” remarked McAllister, when a
thorough search of the house had been made.</p>

<p class='c009' >“The tracks in the snow will settle that question
when daylight comes to enable us to see
them,” said Ronald.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Na, na, sir; it’s snowin’ fast the noo, and
they’ll be all covered up brawly by that,” responded
McAllister.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Then take a lantern and look for them at
once,” Miriam said, speaking with energy and
decision.</p>

<p class='c009' >“An’ so we wull! Sure, thin, the young
misthress is the smartest o’ the lot o’ us all!”
cried Barney, seizing a light and leading the
way, McAllister following.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Well?” Ronald asked, in an excited tone,
as they re-entered the room.</p>

<p class='c009' >“’Twas as I surmised, sir; the mon came his
lane,” said McAllister.</p>

<p class='c009' >“An’ it’s mesilf that cud a’most tak’ me oath
that ’twas Phalim O’Rourke,” added Barney,
setting down the light, and turning from one to
another of the little group in strong excitement.
“I cudn’t see his face that plain, to be
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_49' id='Page_49'>49</a></span>
sure, fer the darkness, but I got a glimpse o’t;
and the soize o’ the raskil was as loike Phalim
as the twin brother o’ ’im.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“And who is Phelim O’Rourke?” asked
Miriam. “Nora spoke of him, but I don’t remember
to have heard of him before.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Sure, Miss Miriam, he’s a returned sojer as
wurruks fer Lawyer Bangs—takin’ care o’ his
horse an’ doin’ anny ither chores wanted in the
fam’ly. An’ it’s mesilf that niver loiked the
look o’ him, let alone that he didn’t git the best
o’ characters from annybody in the rigiment;
in fact, miss, he had the name o’ bein’ as big a
thafe as the nixt one.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Are you willing to repeat what you have
just said before a magistrate?” asked Ronald.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Sure, sor; an’ fer what wouldn’t I?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“It will probably anger Bangs, as O’Rourke
is in his employ.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Sorra a bit wad I care fer that same, sor,”
returned Barney, with a scornful laugh, “barrin’
the thrifle o’ plisure it moight affoord me,”
he added, with a gleam of fun in his eye.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008' >Before the sun was an hour high Prairieville
was greatly excited over the news of
the burglary at Lakeside and the subsequent
arrest of O’Rourke on suspicion of having been
concerned in it.</p>

<p class='c009' >He was, however, speedily at large again,
Nolan not being able to swear positively to his
identity, and Colonel Bangs coming forward
with an <i>alibi</i> in his favor. He made oath that
O’Rourke had been with him in his private
office at the precise time when he was supposed
to have been at Lakeside taking the
money from the parlor cupboard.</p>

<p class='c009' >He (Bangs) had had a fit of wakefulness, and
thinking it must be time to rise, had summoned
Phelim to light a fire in the office. On looking
at his watch, when Phelim came in answer to
the summons, he had found it barely three
o’clock. Still, feeling sure he should not be
able to sleep again, he had his order carried
out. The fire was slow to burn, and Phelim
did not leave the room till the clock had struck
four—long after McAllister and Nolan had
given up their pursuit of the burglar and returned
to Lakeside.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_51' id='Page_51'>51</a></span>
This testimony, of course, completely exonerated
O’Rourke, unless upon the unlikely supposition
that Lawyer Bangs was perjuring himself
to shield one in whom he had no greater
interest than that of a master in his servant.
Barney Nolan was, perhaps, the only person
who still indulged strong suspicions against
Phelim.</p>

<p class='c009' >There was a grain of truth in the lawyer’s
story. He had called Phelim from his bed between
two and three o’clock that morning, but
it was by an arrangement entered into the previous
evening, during a private interview held
shortly after O’Rourke’s return from the depot;
and without waiting to light a fire at all the
Irishman had set out on his evil errand.</p>

<p class='c009' >After making good his escape from his pursuers
(McAllister and Nolan) he gained Bangs’s
residence by a circuitous route, and, under
cover of the darkness, crept cautiously in at a
back door, opened for him by the lawyer himself,
who had a few moments before taken his
stand beside it, and was waiting there, listening
intently for the expected sound of approaching
footsteps.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Ah, at last!” he exclaimed, half under his
breath, as his accomplice stepped in. “Don’t
breathe so loud if you can help it; some one
may be listening. This way—into the office.”</p>

<p class='c009' >They groped their way through the dark passage
into a room beyond, dimly lighted by a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_52' id='Page_52'>52</a></span>
smouldering fire. Bangs struck a match and
lighted a lamp.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Won’t it shine out intil the street, sor?”
asked Phelim, glancing apprehensively around
at the windows.</p>

<p class='c009' >“No; can’t you see that the shutters are
closed and the blinds drawn down? Now, what
success? I was never on any former occasion
so anxious to have you succeed.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I s’pose not, sor, seein’ as there’s on’y us
two to divide the plunder this toime. An’ it’s
mesilf as should pocket the lion’s share, I’m a
thinkin’, seein’ as yer honor kep’ safe under
shelter here, while I done all the wurruk an’
tuk all the resk.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Ah, but if suspicion fastens upon you, I’m
the man to save you from the clutches of the
law! But here, man, let’s see what the spoil
amounts to before we quarrel over the division.”</p>

<p class='c009' >At that Phelim drew a little package from
his breast-pocket and opened it, Bangs looking
on with eagle-eyed watchfulness and suspicion.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Ah, what’s that? a thousand-dollar note!”
he exclaimed, clutching eagerly at it.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Half’s moine, sor; don’t ye forgit that!”
growled Phelim, keeping fast hold of one end.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Tut, man! it’s marked—do you see?—and
won’t be of any use to either of us,” grunted
Bangs, letting go of the note in disgust.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Eh! What difference does that make?”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_53' id='Page_53'>53</a></span>
queried Phelim, examining it critically and with
a crestfallen air.</p>

<p class='c009' >“All the difference in the world; for, of
course, we couldn’t pass it without exposing
ourselves to almost certain detection as having
had a share in the robbery.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Phelim ripped out an oath, adding, “They’s
all marked—ivery wan ov thim; an’ I’ve resked
a tarm o’ years in the pinetintiary fer jist nothin’
at all at all!”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Never fear; I’ll take care of that,” returned
Bangs, grimly. “I can’t afford to let
you rot in prison so long as you share your
profits with me,” he added, with an unpleasant
laugh. “You’d better leave these with me.
They’ll be of no use to you, and if found on
your person would send you to jail in spite of
all I or anybody else could do to keep you out
of it.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Mabbe they moight come intil use wan o’
these days,” muttered Phelim, turning the
smaller notes over in his hands and gazing ruefully
at them. “I’ll kape these fer the prisent,
and yer honor can hide that big wan in yer
strong box, rememberin’ it’s to be divided
atween us whin the toime comes.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“All right,” said Bangs, adding to himself,
with an inward chuckle, “but possession’s nine
points of the law.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Then he went on to urge the wisdom of leaving
the smaller notes also in his care, assuring
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_54' id='Page_54'>54</a></span>
Phelim it would be highly dangerous for him to
retain them in his possession, till at length all
but one were surrendered to him.</p>

<p class='c009' >Phelim then stole on tiptoe to the attic room
appropriated to his use, undressed, and got into
bed, where, some hours later, he was found by
the constable, fast asleep, and taken into custody.</p>

<p class='c009' >Bangs, having seen the prisoner discharged,
went directly from the magistrate’s office to
Lakeside to condole with the family on their
loss and suggest measures for the recovery of
the money and the apprehension of the thief.</p>

<p class='c009' >On being told that the notes were marked,
he expressed himself so confident of their final
recovery that the despoiled family were quite
cheered, and Miriam, in her thankfulness for
the hope his words gave them, was more gracious
to him than she had been for a long time.</p>

<p class='c009' >He observed it with great satisfaction, and,
thinking he had made a favorable opening,
began putting questions, though in a guarded
way, with the design of obtaining the information
he so greatly desired in respect to their
hold upon the property and the extent to which
this loss was likely to embarrass them.</p>

<p class='c009' >But divining his motive, her manner at once
changed to one of extreme coldness and hauteur,
as she gave him distinctly to understand that
she would brook no prying into her affairs.</p>

<p class='c009' >He replied with an angry denial of the correctness
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_55' id='Page_55'>55</a></span>
of the implication; his queries were
put from a sincere desire to be of service, and
from no other motive; prying curiosity was
utterly beneath him—utterly foreign to his
character. And with that he rose, bowed
himself out, and went away in a rage.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Mirry, dear,” remonstrated the gentle old
grandmother, “I’m afraid you are too proud
and ready to take offence. It may be the
colonel only meant to be kind.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I don’t believe it, grandma; I doubt if
the man ever did anything from a purely unselfish
motive.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I fear you have mortally offended him,”
remarked Ronald, with a slight laugh.</p>

<p class='c009' >“I hope so, indeed,” she returned, her breast
heaving and her eyes sparkling, “and that his
sister may take up his quarrel sufficiently to secure
us against a visit of condolence from her.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Vain hope! Bangs’s anger was not of the
kind to lead him to abandon his purpose; and
the next day Mrs. Wiley, as sweet, smiling, and
gracious as ever, again presented herself at
their door.</p>

<p class='c009' >Bertie showed her into the sitting-room,
which she found quite deserted, though
through the open door of the adjoining bedroom
she caught a glimpse of Ronald reclining
upon his couch.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Is your poor, dear brother worse?” she
asked.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_56' id='Page_56'>56</a></span>
“He’s not quite so well to-day, ma’am,”
Bertie answered, placing a chair for her near
the fire. “Please sit down, and I’ll call grandmother.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Sister Miriam too, my dear; I came to see
them both.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Mirry is busy with the baking; she can’t
come, I know; but I’ll tell her,” the child answered,
softly closing Ronald’s door, in obedience
to a sign from him, then passing into the
kitchen, where the ladies of the family were
busied with housewifely labors, the grandmother
preparing vegetables for dinner, Miriam
making pies and baking bread; for they kept
no servant or cook except in the busy harvest
time.</p>

<p class='c009' >Both turned an anxious look upon Bertie as
he came in. They had thought, on hearing the
ring, that the caller was probably Mr. Himes,
the holder of the mortgage, coming for his interest.
It was due that day; he had always
been very punctual in calling for it, and hitherto
had never failed to find it ready for him.</p>

<p class='c009' >Bertie did not wait to be questioned. “It’s
that lady that always smiles and calls everybody
‘dear,’” he said, “and she came to see
you both—grandmother and Mirry.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Mrs. Wiley!” ejaculated Miriam, her
cheeks flushing hotly. “I wish she had less
leisure to bestow upon us—enough to do at
home to keep her there.”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_57' id='Page_57'>57</a></span>
“Ah, well, child, we must try to have patience!
I dare say she means to be very kind,”
sighed the old lady, hastily washing her hands
and taking off the large work-apron worn to
protect her neat calico dress. “I hope she
won’t stay long, though, or I shall not be able
to get these potatoes and turnips ready in time
for dinner.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Never mind that, grandma,” returned
Miriam; “I can manage it all if you will excuse
me to her; but I cannot and will not leave
my baking to see her for even a moment.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Bangs had given his sister a detailed account
of his yesterday’s interview with Miriam, arousing
in her breast fierce anger against the girl.
“How dared she treat advances from my
brother in that style!” she exclaimed, grinding
her teeth. “She shall be well paid for it,
the impudent hussy! I hope you are cured
now of the desire to make her your wife; but
get the property if you can. I’ll do all in my
power to help you.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“And with such an ally I can hardly fail,”
he responded, with grim satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c009' >So this was the secret object of her call.</p>

<p class='c009' >She had at first wished to see Miriam; but
before Mrs. Heath came to her she decided that
events had shaped themselves in the very best
manner for the carrying out of her schemes;
the old lady was likely to be just now in the
state of mind most favorable to her designs
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_58' id='Page_58'>58</a></span>
upon her; gentle-tempered and loath to see
the feelings of another wounded, she would
naturally feel anxious to make amends for
Miriam’s rudeness to Avery; and with a mind
full of their recent loss, she would open her
heart in response to well-simulated sympathy.</p>

<p class='c009' >The event proved Mrs. Wiley’s shrewdness
and penetration; the guileless old lady straightway
fell into her trap. But of course the wily
woman approached her object in a roundabout
way, and while she listened to a circumstantial
account of the robbery, given in response to
her earnest request, there was a second arrival.</p>

<p class='c009' >Miriam, glancing from the window, saw the
holder of the mortgage drive up to the gate in
his farm wagon.</p>

<p class='c009' >“There he is!” she exclaimed. “Bertie,
run out and ask Mr. Himes if he will mind coming
to the kitchen to see me. Tell him I can’t
leave my baking just now, and as there is a
lady caller in the sitting-room, and no fire in
the parlor, this is the only place where we can
have a comfortable private talk.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Bertie obeyed, and in another minute or two
Mr. Himes was stamping the snow from his
feet on the back porch.</p>

<p class='c009' >Miriam opened the door, bade him a cheerful
good-morning, invited him in, and set a chair
near the fire, apologizing at the same time for
asking him there.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Needn’t say another word, Miss Heath,”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_59' id='Page_59'>59</a></span>
he said, seating himself and glancing about him;
“it’s a nice, comfortable place to come to out o’
the cold and the snow; neat as wax and warm
as toast. But I’m in somethin’ of a hurry, having
a long ride to get back home, ye know, and
it’s snowing so fast that the roads will be dreadful
heavy afore night; so you’ll excuse me if I
begin on business at once.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Miriam had grown pale, and he noticed it.</p>

<p class='c009' >“I don’t want to be hard on ye,” he said;
“you’ve always been prompt with that interest,
and I know you was a hopin’ fer to pay off
a part o’ the principal this fall. I don’t calkilate
ye can do that now (I heard in town this
mornin’ ye’d been robbed; and I’m mighty
sorry fer it, fer your sake as well’s my own;
and I say that gang o’ burglars had ought to be
strung up higher’n Haman, every one on ’em);
but I hope they didn’t git all, and that you kin
let me have the interest, for I’m wantin’ it bad.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I wish I could, Mr. Himes,” Miriam said,
low and falteringly; “but the burglar got so
nearly all, that I can pay only fifty dollars to-day.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Why, that’s only a quarter of it!”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes, I know; and I’m very sorry.”</p>

<p class='c009' >She went on to explain about the loss of the
notes and the ground of their hope of speedily
recovering them, adding a promise to pay off
the remainder of the interest and half the principal
immediately upon their restoration.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_60' id='Page_60'>60</a></span>
“Well, well, I hope ye’ll git it,” he said.
“I don’t want to be hard on ye,” he repeated;
“if ye can’t, ye can’t; and though it’s dreadful
inconvenient, I’ll wait a little, hoping the rascal
will be caught with all he stole from you.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Miriam took her purse from her pocket and
a fifty-dollar note from it. “You see I expected
you, Mr. Himes,” she said, with a sad sort
of smile, and pointing to a little side table, where
were pen, ink, and paper. “Will you write me
a receipt for this? And then, if you are not in
too great haste, you must let me set you out a
lunch, for you must be hungry after your long
ride.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Thank’e; I am that; and your cookin’ has
a powerful good smell,” he returned, pocketing
the note, seating himself at the table, and taking
up the pen; “I don’t know but it’ll pay to
take time to snatch a mouthful or so.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Regarding this as an acceptance of her invitation,
Miriam moved briskly about, spread a
snowy cloth on one end of the large table at
which she had been at work, and by the time
the farmer had gone through with the business
of writing the receipt—a slow and toilsome one
to him—had quite a tempting little repast of
cold meat, hot rolls and butter, pie, and gingerbread
ready for him.</p>

<p class='c009' >He did it hasty but ample justice—eating
being more in his line than writing—thanked
her with hearty praise of her cooking, and went
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_61' id='Page_61'>61</a></span>
away, his parting words a strongly expressed
hope that the apprehension of the thief would
soon put her in a position to keep her promises
of payment to him.</p>

<p class='c009' >As Miriam closed the door upon him and
turned to her work again, her heart was heavy
with a sad foreboding of the consequences to
her dear ones and herself should that hope fail
of realization.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Bertie,” she said, noticing the child standing
at the window intently watching Mr. Himes
as he made his way down the garden-path toward
his horses and wagon, “what made you
stare so at the man while he was eating? I
was quite ashamed of your rudeness.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Why, sister,” returned the child, slowly,
“he never thanked the Lord at all for his
victuals, and I was watching to see him choke—you
know grandmother said the other day
she should expect to choke if she did that way.
But he didn’t, though, not a bit.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Grandma would tell you that our Father in
heaven is very kind and patient with us all, and
that that is another reason why we should not
abuse His goodness,” Miriam answered, in a
cheerful tone, the thought of that goodness
helping her to throw off for a time her heavy
burden of care.</p>

<p class='c009' >Not much occurring in her vicinity ever
escaped the sharp eyes and ears of Madam
Wiley. She had seen Mr. Himes piloted by
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_62' id='Page_62'>62</a></span>
Bertie to the kitchen door, and full of curiosity
in regard to his errand there, had strained her
ears to hear the talk between him and Miriam;
but the girl’s tones were low, the farmer’s utterance
was indistinct, and Miriam had purposely
seated him on the side of the room farthest
from the communicating door between it
and the sitting-room; besides, there was the
distracting necessity of listening to and answering
the remarks of Mrs. Heath.</p>

<p class='c009' >With all these hindrances, the seeker after
information found the task she had set herself
beset with difficulties. She could not get so
much as an inkling of the subject-matter of discourse
in the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c009' >It was very provoking; and only by the most
determined effort was she able to maintain her
suavity of speech and manner and pay sufficient
attention to what the old lady said, to avoid
answering wide of the mark. But at last the
farmer went, and rallying all her energies to
the successful carrying out of her purpose, she
skilfully drew the old lady on to pour into her
sympathizing ear the story of their family difficulties
and perplexities.</p>

<p class='c009' >“But, dear Mrs. Heath, you surely need not
feel quite cast down by this loss, seeing that
you own this lovely place. You have it quite
clear of incumbrance, have you not?—no mortgage
on it? no flaw in the title?” she at length
queried in her sweetest, most tenderly sympathetic
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_63' id='Page_63'>63</a></span>
tones; and her victim was just beginning
a sad-voiced, hesitating reply when Ronald,
who had some time before softly set his door
ajar, called:</p>

<p class='c009' >“Grandmother!”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Ah! excuse me for a moment, my boy is
wanting something,” the old lady said, hastily
rising and hurrying to him.</p>

<p class='c009' >He motioned to her to close the door after
her; then, drawing her down to him, whispered
in her ear, “Grandmother, don’t trust that
woman; don’t let her know anything of our
affairs.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Well, no, child, not if it vexes you; but
I’m sure she means very kindly. But what
shall I do? I never was good at evading questions;
I can’t tell a lie, and don’t know any
other way to avoid telling the truth.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Well, I’d sooner talk to her as Mirry did
to her brother the other day than let her pry
into the family secrets. But bring her in here
to see me, and let me always be present at your
interviews after this. I’ll warrant she’ll put a
curb upon her curiosity when I’m by.”</p>

<p class='c009' >In accordance with his wishes, the invitation
was promptly given; but suddenly, finding it
high time she was at home, the unwelcome
visitor took her departure.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008' >Mr. Himes, or “Old Himes,” as he was
often, with irreverent familiarity, designated
in the neighborhood, took his seat at the
supper-table in his own kitchen and looked
across it with an expression of mingled contempt
and disgust at the woman who sat opposite
and poured his coffee.</p>

<p class='c009' >Her face, though young and blooming, was
hardly clean; her frowzy, unkempt hair was in
curl papers over her forehead; her dress, originally
a gayly colored calico, soiled, faded, and
torn—a not inviting picture for even a rough,
hard-working old farmer to see at the head of
his table.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Things has changed considerable since
courtin’ days, B’lindy,” he remarked in a bitter,
sarcastic tone. “You used to slick up real
nice in them times when you knowed I was
comin’.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Of course I did; but now my fortin’s
made, what ud be the use o’ goin’ to all that
trouble?” she returned, with a short laugh.</p>

<p class='c009' >“It’s a kind o’ cheatin’, I think,” he went
on, eyeing her with increasing disgust, “to
’low a man to marry you with the idee that he’s

gettin’ a neat, managin’, orderly woman, and
then turn out a slattern such as you.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Not a bit more cheatin’ than fer a man to
give a woman the notion that he’a a goin’ to
pet and humor her and give her everything she
wants, and then, when he’s got her fast, turn
out mean and stingy and hard, wantin’ to force
her to work mornin’, noon, and night, like a
nigger, and never have nothin’ decent to wear,
let alone a cent o’ money to call her own,” she
retorted, angrily.</p>

<p class='c009' >“I was just objectin’ to your not lookin’ decent.
You’ve got clo’es a plenty if you’d wear
’em.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I haven’t. I’d ought to have a new dress
this minute, and a handsome one too. I’m sure
I deserve it fer throwin’ myself away on an old
codger like you when there was a plenty o’
likely young fellers as would a been glad
enough to get me, and treat me decent, too!”
she cried, bursting into angry tears.</p>

<p class='c009' >“That isn’t no way to get nothin’ out o’ me,
I kin tell ye!” he growled.</p>

<p class='c009' >“You’re an old brute! You’re always abusin’
me,” she sobbed. “As if anybody could
keep fixed up and doin’ all the hard, dirty work
I have to do.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Some folks kin. There’s Miss Heath, now;
no matter what she’s doin’ she’s always neat
as a pin—hair done up smooth, dress clean and
fresh, if it ain’t but a cheap calico.”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_66' id='Page_66'>66</a></span>
“Pity you hadn’t married her!”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Just what I think—if I could a got her.
Don’t know about that, seein’ as I never asked
her. I was fool enough to be took in with your
black eyes and red cheeks and simperin’ ways.
But I wouldn’t a been if I’d knowed what a
poor fist you’d make at housekeepin’ an’ cookin’,
lettin’ things run to waste, and how you’d
spoil all your good looks by keepin’ yerself
more’n half the time so slatternly and dirty.
Neatness and cleanliness are better, to my way
o’ thinkin’, than all the finery in the world.”</p>

<p class='c009' >They were an ill-assorted couple, of uncongenial
disposition and utterly dissimilar tastes
and opinions, as was not surprising in view of
the fact that they had been very differently
brought up, and that she was the younger by
some forty years.</p>

<p class='c009' >She, a penniless, almost friendless orphan,
had married for a home and with the vain expectation
of being a petted darling, who would
have little to do but deck herself in finery; he,
to gratify a sudden foolish fancy which had
speedily changed to disgust when he became
acquainted with the true character of its object.</p>

<p class='c009' >Such scenes of mutual anger and recrimination
were now by no means of rare occurrence
between them. He presently rose, and with a
parting fling at her untidy appearance and
faulty housewifery, went out to attend to his
cattle.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_67' id='Page_67'>67</a></span>
Belinda, springing to her feet, shook her
clinched fist at his back as he disappeared
through the doorway, and muttering, “You
old tyrant, I’ll pay you off one o’ these fine
days, that I will!” began gathering up the
dishes and clearing the table with angry jerks
and a great deal of clatter.</p>

<p class='c009' >She smiled a grim smile of satisfaction as, on
going to the door an hour later, she saw her
husband walking briskly down the road in the
direction of the nearest neighbor’s.</p>

<p class='c009' >“There, he’s off for a good long talk with
Mr. Harkness, and I’ll have the house to myself
for awhile,” she said, half aloud, having,
from being much alone, fallen into the habit of
talking audibly to herself.</p>

<p class='c009' >The sun had set, and within doors it was
growing dark. She lighted a lamp, swept and
otherwise set to rights her dirty, disorderly
kitchen, released her hair from its curl papers,
combed, brushed, and arranged it becomingly
before a looking-glass hanging on the wall
above a side table.</p>

<p class='c009' >Then, lamp in hand, she went into an adjoining
bedroom, where she changed her dingy,
dirty dress for a comparatively new and clean
one, adding to her adornment collar, cuffs, and
a showy breastpin.</p>

<p class='c009' >She stood for several minutes smiling and
simpering at her reflection in the glass; then,
pulling open a bureau drawer, took from it a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_68' id='Page_68'>68</a></span>
scarlet shawl, which she folded with care and
threw over her plump shoulders. Next, a bonnet
of crimson cotton velvet profusely trimmed
with cheap feathers and flowers was taken from a
bandbox, turned about admiringly in her hands,
then tried on before the glass with a repetition
of the simpering and smiling.</p>

<p class='c009' >“It’s just splendid!” she said, aloud, “and
the becomingest thing out. But what on earth
was that?” she cried, starting, and turning
toward the window with a frightened look.
She had seemed to hear a quick breath, a muttered
curse.</p>

<p class='c009' >She stood for a moment trembling with fear,
gazing at the window with dilated eyes. There
were no shutters, but a short muslin curtain
was drawn across the lower sash, completely
obstructing her view of any and everything that
might be upon the outside. “What was
there?” She dared not go nearer to examine
and satisfy her doubts by raising curtain or
sash and looking out.</p>

<p class='c009' >But there was no repetition of the sound, and
presently she concluded she had been mistaken;
it was all imagination; and she fell to admiring
herself and her finery as before.</p>

<p class='c009' >There was a face at the window, pressed
close against the glass, where the parting of the
curtain left a slight opening through which a
good view might thus be obtained of all that
was transpiring within the room. It was the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_69' id='Page_69'>69</a></span>
face of a tall, stoutly built man, very much
younger than her husband and more comely of
feature, but his expression as he glared upon
her was at times almost diabolical.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes, them’s the things she’s sold herself
fer,” he muttered, grinding his teeth with rage.
Then, softening a little, “But she is a purty
crayther, an’ it’s mesilf, Phalim O’Rourke, that
cud a’most be fool enough to thry her agin if
the ould thafe of a husband was out o’ the
way.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Then again, as he watched her childish delight
in her finery, the smiling, dancing eyes,
the rosy cheeks dimpling, and the red lips
wreathing themselves in smiles, his face darkened
with jealous rage, and muttered curses
were on his tongue. She was happy with his
rival, the man who had robbed him of her (the
pretty girl who had promised herself to him before
he went away to the war) by the superior
attraction of a well-filled purse.</p>

<p class='c009' >The terror in her face when she overheard
his curse gave him a sort of fiendish delight for
the moment. He would not have cared had
she come to the window and found him there,
yet he thought it more prudent not to make her
aware of his presence or further excite her fears.</p>

<p class='c009' >At length the sound of approaching footsteps
crunching the hard, frozen snow in the road on
the other side of the fence sent him from the
window.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_70' id='Page_70'>70</a></span>
He stepped quickly into the shadow of the
house, then behind a tree, whence he could
have almost laid his hand on the shoulder of the
old farmer as he passed on his way from the
front gate to the kitchen door.</p>

<p class='c009' >“I moight a blowed his brains out and he’d
never a knowed what hurt him,” the intruder
said to himself with a bitter laugh as he
turned and stole away to seek shelter in the
barn.</p>

<p class='c009' >Meanwhile Himes was shaking and pounding
the kitchen door. Belinda heard him, hastily
threw aside bonnet and shawl, snatched up the
lamp, and hurried to admit him.</p>

<p class='c009' >“What are ye locked up fer?” he growled.
“Keep a man freezin’ outside till ye choose to
let him in, will ye?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“’Twasn’t two minutes,” she said; “and I
can tell you I’m not a goin’ to stay here alone
after dark with the doors unfastened and
burglars about.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Fixed up at last!” he remarked, jeeringly,
and eyeing her askance as she set the lamp on
the table.</p>

<p class='c009' >Picking it up, he walked into the bedroom.
She had left the door ajar in her haste, and he
seemed to know by intuition that she had been
there, and at something she would prefer to
hide from him.</p>

<p class='c009' >That was the fact; for though he must, of
course, learn at some time of her new purchases,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_71' id='Page_71'>71</a></span>
she wished, since it was sure to anger him, to
put off the evil day as long as possible.</p>

<p class='c009' >She followed him with a half-terrified, half-defiant
air.</p>

<p class='c009' >“What, more finery?” he exclaimed, turning
on her, his face flushing angrily. “Do you
intend to ruin me, woman?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I’ve earned it—every cent of it—and ten
times more!” she said, straightening herself
and regarding him with scornful, flashing eyes.
“Do you suppose I’m a goin’ to cook, bake,
wash, scrub, and mend for you fer nothin’?
Not if I know myself, I ain’t!”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Humph! We’ll see about that!” he grunted.
“I’ll go to every store in Prairieville and
Riverside, Frederic and Fairfield, and tell ’em
not to trust you, fer I won’t be responsible fer
yer debts.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Very well; then you’ll pay good wages to
me or somebody else, or do your work yourself!”</p>

<p class='c009' >He made no reply in words, but snatching
the bonnet, carried it out to the kitchen, and
threw it into the fire. She rushed after him,
and made frantic efforts to save it; but he held
her back, and grimly smiling, watched it slowly
burn to ashes.</p>

<p class='c009' >Then she dried her eyes and vowed vengeance;
she would have a divorce and make
him maintain her without work.</p>

<p class='c009' >“I hain’t the least objection in the world to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_72' id='Page_72'>72</a></span>
the first part o’ that,” he said, “but we’ll see
about t’other.”</p>

<p class='c009' >For hours darkness and silence had reigned
supreme in the farm-house. Belinda had wept
herself to sleep by the side of her now detested
spouse, and he, too, was wrapped in slumber
most profound.</p>

<p class='c009' >The door from the kitchen opened with sudden,
noiseless movement, and with equally
noiseless step a tall, dark figure drew near the
bed. Slowly and cautiously it turned the light
of a dark lantern upon the face of the sleeping
woman and bent over her a darkly scowling
face whose eyes gleamed with concentrated
rage and hate.</p>

<p class='c009' >He held the lantern in his left hand, in the
right a dagger. He glanced at it, at her, and
back again at it. Had her eyes opened at that
instant, perhaps she would have died of fright;
but she slept on, breathing softly and regularly,
though her face wore a sad and troubled look,
and traces of tears were on her cheeks, her pillow
wet with them.</p>

<p class='c009' >The sight moved him, stern and revengeful
as he was; he gazed on, his face gradually
softening, and finally turned away, slipping the
dagger into its sheath, then half withdrawing it
as his eye fell on the old man on the farther side
of the bed, soundly sleeping also, with his face
to the wall, and little dreaming that there was
but a step between him and a death of violence
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_73' id='Page_73'>73</a></span>
and blood. One moment of hesitation, and the
intruder withdrew as stealthily as he had entered,
passing on through the kitchen into the
open air.</p>

<p class='c009' >“I’ll let ’em alone,” he muttered, “and
they’ll revinge Phalim O’Rourke on aich ither
better’n he cud do it hisself; an’ that widout
anny danger o’ State prison fer sendin’ ’em
aforehand to purgatory, that mabbe wadn’t be
no worse nor what they’re makin’ atween theirselves
now.”</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008' >There was a belt of timber, principally oak
and hickory, on the Himes place, and one
afternoon the old man informed his wife that
“a young feller was comin’ to help him for a
week or so fellin’ trees and cuttin’ ’em up into
cord wood.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“More work for me, I s’pose,” she said, in a
sullen tone.</p>

<p class='c009' >“He’ll board and lodge here. You kin git a
room ready fer him and set an extry plate onto
the table. He’ll be here to supper to-night if
he’s a man o’ his word,” was the nonchalant
reply. And Mr. Himes stepped from the
kitchen door and walked off in the direction of
the barn.</p>

<p class='c009' >Belinda’s face brightened as she went upstairs
and busied herself in making a bed in a little
room usually appropriated to the use of the
hired man, when they had one. They had
now been without one for some time, and she
was inexpressibly weary of the uncongenial society
of her old husband. Any change, she
thought, must be for the better.</p>

<p class='c009' >She was bustling about, setting her table
while the supper was cooking over the fire,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_75' id='Page_75'>75</a></span>
when the outer door opened, and a man’s step—not
that of her husband, yet strangely familiar—crossed
the threshold. She turned to see
whose it was, then uttered a low cry full of terror,
while her cheek blanched and the dish in her
hand fell to the floor with a crash and lay in
fragments at her feet.</p>

<p class='c009' >For several minutes they stood silently gazing
into each other’s eyes, hers dilating with fear,
his stern and gloomy, a grim smile upon his lips.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yis, it’s me,” he said at last; “an’ what
have ye to say fer yersilf, false, desateful,
treacherous crayther that ye are?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“They told me ye was killed,” she answered,
in a shaking voice, staggering back and dropping
into a chair, but never taking her eyes
from his face; “shot down dead in one o’ them
awful battles; and I thought it must be your
ghost.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I’m a livin’ man an’ no ghost,” he returned,
with a mocking laugh. “An’ ye soon comforted
yersilf wid ould Himes and his house an’
farm, did ye?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“What could I do? When you was gone,
the rest was all alike to me. I’d no home, nobody
in the wide world to care for me,” she
sobbed, covering her face with her hands;
“and he said he’d be so good to me—I should
have everything I wanted. But it isn’t so; he’s
an awful man to live with; and I’m just heart
broke, that I am!”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_76' id='Page_76'>76</a></span>
“An’ if ’twas all to do over agin, ye wadn’t
give me up fer the likes o’ him—house an’ farm
an’ all?” he queried, drawing a step nearer and
bending toward her with an eager look in his
eyes, while his tones softened till they were
almost affectionate.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Never!” she cried, passionately. “I’d
take you without a penny sooner than him with
all the gold of Californy.” And her face, lifted
to his, was full of yearning love and entreaty.</p>

<p class='c009' >“I knowed it, me own darlint, jewel o’ me
heart!” he cried, clasping her in his arms and
heaping fond caresses upon her. “It’s an evil
fate that’s come atween us; but him that’s
robbed me’s an ould man, an’ I’m young, an’
mabbe my turn’ll come when he’s took out o’
the way.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Go! go! run! he’ll be here in a minute,
maybe, and kill you if he finds you here!” she
cried, hastily releasing herself and pushing him
from her.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Kill me! ha! ha! that wake ould man! Do
yees think I’d come off second best in a foight
wid the loikes o’ him?” he asked, with a scornful
laugh. “But yees needn’t be afeard, B’lindy;
I’m the chap as he’s hired to help him chop
down his trees.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Oh!” she exclaimed, with a look of relief.
“But we must behave cautious, Phelim—mustn’t
let him suspect as we’ve ever set eyes
on each other till now.”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_77' id='Page_77'>77</a></span>
He assented to the wisdom of her proposition,
and as footsteps were heard approaching
from without, moved quickly to the farther
side of the room, and as the master of the house
came in, seemed very much engaged with the
county paper which he found lying on the window-sill.</p>

<p class='c009' >Belinda was stooping over the fire, stirring
something stewing in a pan.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Supper not ready?” Himes asked, in a
surly tone. Then, catching sight of the new-comer,
“Ah! so you’re here, O’Rourke! Well,
set up to the table. I guess we’ll have something
to eat after a bit.”</p>

<p class='c009' >By previous arrangement, Teddy McManus
was to temporarily supply Phelim’s place with
Bangs, thus leaving Phelim at liberty to stay
away as long as should seem advisable for their
common interest. He accordingly spent several
weeks in the employ of Farmer Himes, felling
trees and cutting wood all day in company
with the old man, and often, in the long evenings,
enjoying a stolen interview with Belinda
when a call upon some neighbor or a visit to
the nearest town had taken her husband out of
the way.</p>

<p class='c009' >The woman’s conscience troubled her sorely
at times; she knew she was doing very wrong,
now that she was the wife of another man, to
let this one talk to her in the old lover-like way;
that was proper enough while she was free to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_78' id='Page_78'>78</a></span>
bestow her heart and hand upon him. But she
stifled the reproaches of the inward monitor,
and went on in the evil course that must end in
sorrow and shame.</p>

<p class='c009' >But O’Rourke had a purpose in coming there
aside from his passion for her and wish to obtain
the money paid him for his work. He was
in Bangs’s employ still, though in a new capacity.</p>

<p class='c009' >“I’ve a little job on hand that mabbe you
cud help me wid, me jewel,” he said to Belinda
one evening in the second week of his stay.</p>

<p class='c009' >“What’s that?” she asked, looking up from
her sewing in some surprise and apprehension.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Nothin’ to fright ye,” he returned, laughing.
“It’s jist this, me darlint. There’s a
gintleman as wants to foind out, fer some raison
o’ his own, if yer ould man’s got a margage—I
belave that’s what they call it—on Lakeside,
the farm belongin’ till the Heaths.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“How should I know if he has?” she returned.
“He never tells me nothin’ about his
business, and I don’t know what a margage is.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“It’s a paper wid writin’ onto it, darlint, and
one as it wudn’t be o’ no use at all at all to
take,” he explained; “not till me nor the gintleman
I was spakin’ av, though mabbe it
moight fer the folks it’s drawed against.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Would you know it if you saw it?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Sorra a bit, jewel, but ye wad; ye can
rade writin’.”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_79' id='Page_79'>79</a></span>
“Yes; but I tell you I don’t know what sort
of a thing it is.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Somethin’ loike this jist—tellin’ that money’s
owed on the farm, an’ if it ain’t paid by sich a
toime, the feller what holds the margage can
sell ’em out and git his money.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Then anybody that had the paper could do
that, couldn’t he?” she asked, with increasing
interest.</p>

<p class='c009' >“No, not if he stole it, the gintleman tould
me; the writin’s got to be fixed to suit, wid the
roight name ontil it. He’ll be afther buyin’ it,
I belave, whin he foinds out all about it; an’
he’ll pay me a purty penny if I foind out an’
let him intil the sacret.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“But what made him think it was here?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Well, a friend o’ his’n see the ould man
over there, an’ somethin’ put it intil her head
as it moight be he wuz afther money, the folks
seemin’ kind o’ distressed loike.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Mr. Himes’s return broke off the conversation,
but it was renewed by Phelim at the first
opportunity, and at length Belinda was prevailed
upon to promise to make an examination of her
husband’s papers if she could in any way manage
to get possession of the key to the strong box
in which they were kept. This key he carried
on his person during the day and put carefully
under his pillow at night. She had never been
permitted to touch it, nor did it seem likely she
ever would be.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_80' id='Page_80'>80</a></span>
But one day, having torn his coat, he brought
it to her to mend.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Mind you do it right away,” he said, “for
I’ll have to wear my Sunday one till it’s done.
I can’t chop wood in that, so I’ll just step over
to Harkness’s to ask what cord wood’s a sellin’
fer now in Prairieville.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Dropping the coat the moment the door
closed on him, Belinda ran to the front window
and watched him stealthily as he crossed the
yard and went out at the gate; then, hurrying
back, she searched the pockets of the coat.</p>

<p class='c009' >Yes, the key was there. She drew it out
with a gleeful laugh. There was nothing she
enjoyed with a keener relish than prying into
whatever he particularly desired to keep secret
from her. First satisfying herself that he had
not discovered his loss and turned back to retrieve
it, she hastened to make use of this
“lucky chance.”</p>

<p class='c009' >It so happened that the first paper she opened
proved to be the one she was in search of.
She read enough to make sure of that, gloated
for several minutes over rolls of bank-notes and
piles of gold and silver coin, feeling strongly
tempted to help herself; but deterred by the
almost certain conviction that her husband
knew to a cent how much was there, she hurriedly
shut down the lid, relocked the box, and
went back to her work.</p>

<p class='c009' >Well for her that she did; for scarcely had
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_81' id='Page_81'>81</a></span>
she taken the first stitch in the garment when
the old man rushed in in breathless haste and
snatched it from her hands.</p>

<p class='c009' >“What’s that for?” she asked, her black eyes
snapping.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Have ye been makin’ free with this?” he
demanded, shaking the key in her face. “It’ll
not be good for ye if ye have.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“With that?” she cried, in well-feigned surprise.
“I only wish I’d knowed it was there.
But if you jerk my work out o’ my hands agin,
ye may do yer mendin’ yerself.”</p>

<p class='c009' >He started upon his errand a second time,
and only waiting until he was well out of sight,
she threw a shawl over her head and ran to the
wood, where Phelim’s axe was descending with
ringing strokes upon a fallen tree. They ceased
at her approach.</p>

<p class='c009' >“What is it?” he asked; “have ye come til
me fer purtection from that ould brute baste?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“No,” she answered, with a scornful laugh,
“he hasn’t got so far as to strike me yet.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Then she went on to tell of her chance opportunity;
how she had improved it, and the discovery
she had made.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Good! good!” he cried, his eyes gleaming
with satisfaction and with greed. “But ye’re
sure now the margage is on the Heath property?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes; certain sure. You’ll not get me into
trouble about it?”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_82' id='Page_82'>82</a></span>
“Niver a bit, me darlint. And so that’s
where the ould divil kapes his money, is it?
How much do ye s’pose he has there?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I didn’t dare look,” she answered, evasively,
“and he’ll take good care I don’t never get
hold o’ that key again. You may count on that.
Now I must run back and do that mendin’
afore he gits home.”</p>

<p class='c009' >She flew back to the house and worked with
nervous haste; the mending must be done before
her husband’s return, lest his suspicions
should be aroused. She had just completed
her task, thrown the coat over a chair-back and
set about getting supper, when he came in.</p>

<p class='c009' >He gave her a sharp, suspicious glance, and
passed on into the next room, where the strong-box
was. He had been thinking on his homeward
walk that perhaps she had found and
made use of the key in those few minutes that
it was out of his possession.</p>

<p class='c009' >He would find out, he said to himself, and if
a dollar of his precious store were missing, he
would demand its instant return. Fortunately
she could not have had time and opportunity to
spend it.</p>

<p class='c009' >Belinda awaited with a quaking heart the result
of his examination. What if she had unwittingly
disarranged the papers! What might
he not do to her in his fury if such were the
case!</p>

<p class='c009' >It seemed a long while that he was there.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_83' id='Page_83'>83</a></span>
Evidently he must be counting his money.
How glad she was that she had resisted the
temptation to take a little! At last he came
out with a satisfied, triumphant look that banished
her fears.</p>

<p class='c009' >Early the next week Phelim O’Rourke returned
to Prairieville, the time of his engagement
with Mr. Himes having expired.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_84' id='Page_84'>84</a></span>
  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008' >“Why! why! why! what’s the meaning
of all this?” cried Mr. Himes, in tones
of mingled anger, amazement, and rebuke;
“did you actually go to bed leaving this outside
door open, Belindy?”</p>

<p class='c009' >It was early in the morning, some two or
three weeks after the events related in our last
chapter, and the two had but just risen to
begin the new day.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Me? Of course not!” returned the wife,
in indignant surprise not unmingled with
fright, running out, only half dressed as she
was, to find her husband standing on the
kitchen hearth, gazing in open-mouthed astonishment
at the wide-open door.</p>

<p class='c009' >He turned angrily upon her. “You must
have done it; you was the last to go to bed.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Ketch me at it!” she said. “I’m too much
afraid o’ them burglars by a great deal.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Burglars!” he echoed, and rushed wildly
into the adjoining room. The lid of his strong-box
was raised, papers were scattered about
the floor. He seemed unable to believe the
evidence of his senses; he rubbed his hand
across his forehead, muttering, “I must be
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_85' id='Page_85'>85</a></span>
dreamin’. Nobody couldn’t never have broke
that lock, nor picked it neither, and—”</p>

<p class='c009' >He stepped to the box and stooped over it
for a moment; then, straightening himself,
turned toward his wife a face from which every
vestige of color had fled.</p>

<p class='c009' >“It’s gone!” he gasped; “every cent of
it!”</p>

<p class='c009' >“How much?” she asked, trembling and
distressed.</p>

<p class='c009' >“All I had; the earnin’s and savin’s o’ years
and years o’ hard work!”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Why didn’t you put it into the bank?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Because I was afeard o’ them; banks breaks
now and agin, and they’re often robbed, too,
by folks inside and out; nobody knows who’s
honest and who isn’t. Oh, dear! oh, dear!”</p>

<p class='c009' >He began picking up the papers and restoring
them to their places, groaning and lamenting
all the time, and even shedding tears.</p>

<p class='c009' >“How quiet they must a done it all!” she
said, shuddering, and glancing about, half expecting
to see a burglar. “I never heard a
sound. And they must have been in our room
to get the key!” she exclaimed, with a fresh
accession of fright at the thought.</p>

<p class='c009' >“No, they wasn’t!” he said, sharply.
“Can’t you see the lock’s broke?”</p>

<p class='c009' >At that she walked back to the kitchen,
closed the outer door, started the fire, and put
the kettle on to boil, her thoughts all the while
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_86' id='Page_86'>86</a></span>
busy with their loss and the manner in which
the robbery had been effected. She knew no
more of it than he did. Phelim had not confided
in her, and as yet she had no suspicion of his
connection with the band of housebreakers and
thieves infesting the valley.</p>

<p class='c009' >The old man was so full of grief and despair
that he could not eat; leaving his breakfast
almost untasted, and bidding his wife attend to
the outdoor work, which he usually did himself,
he mounted his swiftest horse and hastened
to the nearest town to see what steps could be
taken toward the recovery of his stolen property.</p>

<p class='c009' >But as before, when committing similar acts
of depredation, the wily villains had managed
their work so adroitly that no clew to their
identity could be found.</p>

<p class='c009' >Weeks passed on without any new light being
thrown upon the matter, and under the grievous
trial Mr. Himes grew constantly more
morose, captious and niggardly toward his
wife, till she declared that life spent alone with
him—and she seldom had any other companion—was
an intolerable burden.</p>

<p class='c009' >Then he took to absenting himself frequently,
sometimes being gone all day long, never
telling her whither he went or on what errand.</p>

<p class='c009' >At length he announced his intention to sell
his place and move into an adjoining State.</p>

<p class='c009' >“What fer?” Belinda asked, in surprise and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_87' id='Page_87'>87</a></span>
dismay. “You couldn’t get a nicer place, and
you’ve always bragged on it so. I’d never have
thought you’d give it up.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“There’s nothin’ wrong with the place,” he
said, “but there’s too many burglars about. I
sha’n’t stay here to be robbed agin soon as I
get a little ahead.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“You’ll stay on here till after harvest, won’t
you?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I tell you, I’m a goin’ jest as soon’s I kin
sell out!” he snapped.</p>

<p class='c009' >Spring had opened, and the farmers were
very busy. Once Mr. Himes would have been
as much so as any, but now he seemed to feel
that he had something else to attend to of more
importance than the cultivation of his land.</p>

<p class='c009' >Miriam Heath, out in the fields one bright
morning with Sandy McAllister and Barney
Nolan, overseeing and directing their operations
there, heard aloud “Halloo, Miss Heath!”
and turning her head, saw Mr. Himes waving
his hand to her from the road.</p>

<p class='c009' >“I must see what he wants,” she said to
Sandy, whose attention had been arrested by
the call as well as her own. “I think you can
go on very well without me now.” And turning
her horse about, she rode up to the fence that
separated the field from the road, and with a
courteous greeting to her caller, asked if he
would go into the house.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Well, yes; p’r’aps I might as well,” he replied,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_88' id='Page_88'>88</a></span>
“if you can spare time fer a little business
talk.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I must always do that,” she answered.
“I was very sorry to hear, some time ago, that
you, too, had been robbed.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes,” he returned, with a heavy sigh;
“and them rascals made a bigger haul than
they did here—got the savin’s o’ years. I
hain’t much left but the farm and the stock. I
hope you’ve got your notes back, Miss Heath.
Fact is, I want that money awful bad now. I’d
be glad if you’d pay the whole thing off, principal
and interest, and take up your mortgage.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I wish I could, indeed,” she said, leading
the way into the house and giving him a chair,
“but it is utterly impossible. We have had no
trace of the notes yet; and though we have
used the closest economy, I have but one hundred
dollars for you now. I will give you a
check on the Prairieville bank for it.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Only a hundred! Why, that will leave
fifty back of the interest due last fall—six
months ago!”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I know it,” she said, with a deeply troubled
look; “but if you will only have patience, I am
sure we will pay it all in time.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I don’t want to be hard on ye, but, as I
said afore, I do want that money awful bad,”
he answered, with a scowl. “I mean to leave
the State, and I’m tryin’ to close things up so’s
to take all I have with me.”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_89' id='Page_89'>89</a></span>
“Have we not always paid you the interest
promptly up to last fall?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes, that’s so.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“And can’t you trust us to send it to you as
fast as we can raise it?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Well, I reckon likely ye’d do it, but I’d a
heap rather take it all with me. I don’t want
to be hard on ye,” he repeated, “and I should
hate to foreclose; but I do want the money
mighty bad.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Miriam’s cheek had grown very pale. “Oh,
Mr. Himes,” she said, clasping her hands entreatingly,
“you wouldn’t do that? You
couldn’t have the heart to do it—to take all we
have and turn us out of house and home?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I’d hate to do it, but every man must look
to his own interests first and foremost.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Do you remember,” she said, low and
huskily, “that it was to save the country my
father borrowed this money and mortgaged his
farm to you? and he gave his life to the cause;
my brother gave his health and strength and
the use of his arm; and what would your property
be worth to-day if the country had gone
to ruin?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Well, maybe not much,” he acknowledged
after a moment’s cogitation, leaning forward
with his eyes on the floor, his hat in his hands
and his elbows on his knees, “and I shouldn’t
like to distress ye. Give me the check for the
hundred, and I’ll wait a spell for the rest.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_90' id='Page_90'>90</a></span>
You’re a girl in a thousand, Miss Miriam, and
I hope you’ll pull through all right yet.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Thank you,” she said, a little tremulously;
“if I do not, it shall not be for lack of trying.
Thank you for your forbearance, Mr. Himes.
You shall have all I can possibly save this year,
and if the crops are good, that will be all the
interest and a large part of the principal. Indeed,
if we recover the stolen notes I dare hope
to pay off the whole this year.”</p>

<p class='c009' >He went away with the comfortable feeling
that he had shown himself a model of generous
forbearance, and was deserving of any amount
of good fortune in requital of it all.</p>

<p class='c009' >“You can just pass that over to my credit,
I don’t care to draw it out to-day,” he said, as
he handed in the check at the bank.</p>

<p class='c009' >As he was stepping into the street again, he
felt a tap on his shoulder, a voice asking, at the
same time,“How are you to-day, Mr. Himes?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Ah! good-day, colonel; how are you?” he
returned, looking round.</p>

<p class='c009' >“I want a little chat with you on business,”
said Bangs, offering his hand with an urbane
smile. “Just step over to my office with me,
won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“You hain’t got on the track o’ them thieves,
hev ye?” queried Himes, half incredulously,
half eagerly, as they walked on together.
“But I s’pose there hain’t no such good news.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I wish I could say there was,” was the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_91' id='Page_91'>91</a></span>
gracious reply; “but they are cunning rogues,
though we may promise ourselves that they’re
sure to be caught finally. No; it’s another
matter I want to speak of to-day. Just step in
and take a chair. I hear you were offering
your farm for sale. Have you found a purchaser
yet?”</p>

<p class='c009' >Himes answered in the negative.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Well, I have a little money to invest, and
don’t know but I might as well put it into
land.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Questions and answers followed—as to the
size of the farm, buildings on it, quality of land,
number of acres under cultivation, etc.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Well, I must ride out and look at it before
I can strike a bargain with you,” the lawyer
said at length. “But haven’t you some other
property for sale—railroad or other stock? mortgages?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes, sir; I have a mortgage that I’d like
mightily to get the cash for,” returned Himes,
catching at the suggestion with unmistakable
avidity.</p>

<p class='c009' >Bangs’s eyes shone; he saw Miriam in his
power. “On what property?” he asked,
knowing full well what the answer would be.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Lakeside—the Heaths’ place. It’s a nice
one.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes, I know it, and wouldn’t mind having
a claim on it. First mortgage? and what’s the
amount?”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_92' id='Page_92'>92</a></span>
“Yes, first—no other on it, fer’s I know;
and it’s for two thousand dollars.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Interest all paid up?”</p>

<p class='c009' >Himes shook his head; then went on to tell
exactly how matters stood between the Heaths
and himself.</p>

<p class='c009' >“I’ll take it, and pay every cent down.
Have you it with you?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“No; it’s at home. I’ll bring it in to-morrow;
that’ll be best, as I’ll want to put the
money in bank for the present,” returned
Himes, meditatively. “I don’t put no more
in the way o’ them burglars, you see; guess
they wouldn’t find it as easy to break into the
bank as into my house. But—”</p>

<p class='c009' >He stopped short, and seemed ill at ease.</p>

<p class='c009' >“What now?” asked Bangs.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Why, you see, I was just a thinkin’ I
wouldn’t like them folks—the Heaths—to be foreclosed
on and sold out. I kind o’ promised Miss
Miriam to wait on ’em a bit, and she’s a girl in—”</p>

<p class='c009' >“You needn’t be afraid to trust them to me,”
smiled Bangs, graciously. “Why, to let you
into a secret”—he leaned over and whispered
the rest into the farmer’s ear—“I expect to
marry the girl.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“You do? Well, all I’ve got to say is, you’ll
get a mighty handsome woman and a first-rate
housekeeper and manager.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I know all that better than anybody can tell
it to me,” returned Bangs, emphatically.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER X.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008' >One lovely afternoon early in May two persons,
a man and a woman, sat side by side
on a log in the wood that formed a part of the
Himes place.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Did iver I hear the loike o’ that!” he exclaimed,
with a long, low whistle, in response
to something she had been telling him. “He
must be crazier nor a loon! goin’ down the
river on a raft wid all his goods aboard. And
the money, too, did yees say, me darlint?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I don’t know, but I suppose so; he’s goin’
to buy land as soon as he gets there. He’s sold
the farm here.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“And the margage on Lakeside,” he supplemented,
nodding his head knowingly.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Has he? How did you find that out? He
never told me a breath about it,” she returned
in some surprise.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Ah, thin,” he chuckled, “sure there’s a
bit av a burrud that whispers things intil
Phalim O’Rourke’s ears whan it’s av impoortance
fer him to know about ’em.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Is that so?” she asked, with a slight laugh.
“But how does that margage concern you?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Ah, that’s me sacret; but sure, the ould
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_94' id='Page_94'>94</a></span>
man’s affairs consarn me, seein’ that a good bet
o’ his money’ll be comin’ till you whan he’s
out o’ the way under the turuf.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I wish he was there now!” she cried, bursting
into sudden passion. “I haven’t the first
bit of comfort in my life for thinkin’ I’m tied
to him, and he growlin’ and scoldin’ from mornin’
to night, and wantin’ me to go dressed like
a beggar. I don’t never have a cent but what
I get by sellin’ milk and eggs, and that won’t
hardly keep me in shoes and stockin’s.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“S’pose, thin, we put ’im out o’ the way,”
he whispered, bending down to look into her
eyes, a lurid light of hate, malice, and revenge
gleaming in his own.</p>

<p class='c009' >She shrank back shuddering, a sudden death-like
pallor overspreading her cheek. “You
can’t mean it!” she said, in a hoarse whisper;
“you’re only jokin’!”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Niver a bit av it!” he ejaculated, with an
oath. “Didn’t he stale you from me? an’
whan I heard it, didn’t I swear to shoot him
down in his tracks loike a dog? An’ whan he’s
afloat on his raft—crazy ould fool that he is!—there’ll
be the wather at hand quite convanient
to tumble him intil, out o’ sight.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“No! no! no!” she cried, recoiling still further,
covering her face with her hands, and shuddering
with horror. “I hate him! I hate him!
but—that would be murder!” she added, with
a gasp, “and we’d be hung for it—both of us.”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_95' id='Page_95'>95</a></span>
“No; no hangin’ in this State!” he said, a
ring of savage triumph in his tones. “And
dead men don’t tell no tales.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Mr. Himes had gone from home that day;
there was no danger of his return for some
hours, and the interview in the wood did not
come to an end till near the time when he
might be expected.</p>

<p class='c009' >Before that the wily villain had, by blandishments,
coaxings, entreaties, appeals to her love
for himself, highly colored pictures of the
happy life they might lead together were she
but free to marry him, as she had promised to
before he went away to the war, and artful allusions
to Himes’s brutal treatment of her, succeeded
in extracting a half-reluctant consent
from Belinda to the robbery and murder of her
husband.</p>

<p class='c009' >She still declared, shudderingly, that she
could not and would not take any active part in
it, but promised not to warn him of his danger
or put any obstacle in the way of the design
upon his property and life.</p>

<p class='c009' >The old farmer, bent on saving the expense
of travel and transportation of goods by rail,
had determined to make a raft of sufficient size
to carry himself, wife, household furniture and
farming implements, and on that descend the
river.</p>

<p class='c009' >In vain neighbors and friends had warned
him of perils from natural obstructions in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_96' id='Page_96'>96</a></span>
channel of the stream and danger from burglars
by night, when, because of those obstructions,
he would be compelled to moor his raft to the
shore. By nature headstrong and opinionated,
he held fast to his purpose.</p>

<p class='c009' >He would need help in making the raft; had
not yet engaged it; for at this time of year,
when there was so much farm work to be done,
it was scarce.</p>

<p class='c009' >Phelim now proposed to offer his services
and those of one or two “friends” on very reasonable
terms. When the raft was completed
and had received its load, one or more of them
would be needed to assist in its navigation, he
said, and that would render the commission of
his contemplated crime a very easy matter
some dark night, when they were moored to
the shore in a lonely spot, and the old man had
fallen asleep.</p>

<p class='c009' >To Belinda’s terrified objection that she
might be suspected of complicity, he answered,
“Niver a bit o’t, me darlint; whaniver ye see
the thing started ye’ll be off loike the wind to
bring help, sure. But the nearest house’ll be a
mile away annyhow, an’ ye’ll not be called
upon to kill yersilf wid runnin’; ye’ll presently
go a bit asier; an’ we’ll mak quick wurruk an’
be off wid the money, lavin’ the ould divil in a
state not to moind his loss afore ye kin git back
wid yer hilp. And thin, whan yees sees what’s
happened till him, ye’ll mak a tirrible cryin’ an’
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_97' id='Page_97'>97</a></span>
lamentation, an’ sure they’ll think you’re heartbroke
intirely.”</p>

<p class='c009' >At length the two separated; Belinda went
back to the house to get supper ready against
her husband’s return, and Phelim, plunging
into the woods, made a circuit of a mile or so,
and striking into the highroad, met Himes riding
slowly homeward.</p>

<p class='c009' >The old man hung his head with a dejected air,
as one whose plans and purposes had miscarried.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Good avenin’, sor,” said Phelim, lifting his
hat as they passed.</p>

<p class='c009' >Himes started and turned his head, for the
Irishman was already somewhat in his rear.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Hollo! is that you, O’Rourke?” he called.
“Come back, will you? I want a word with
you.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Phelim was at his horse’s side in an instant,
asking, “What’s your wull, sor?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I’ve a job on hand, and want help with it;
could you come and take a hand at it for a day
or two?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Sure, sor, if I knowed what it was I cud
aisier tell that same.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“It’s the making of a raft over yonder on the
river-bank; ’twon’t take much knowledge beyond
how to wield an axe and hammer in nails,
and ye’re not wantin’ in that or in strength.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Well, sor, I’ll drame on it the night an’ lat
yees know in the mornin’,” Phelim answered,
turning to go.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_98' id='Page_98'>98</a></span>
“Wait a minute,” Himes said. “If ye can
bring one or two more fellows with you, it’ll be
all the better; we’ll get through the sooner,
and that’ll suit me first-rate, for I’m gettin’ in
a big hurry to be off.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Where, sor, if I may be so bould?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Down the river, clear out o’ this State,
where the laws are not severe enough on burglars
and cut-throats to make honest folks feel
that their lives and property are tolerable
safe.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Thin, sor, beggin’ yer pardin fer the liberty,
ye’d betther kape it close that yer manin’
to thravel in sich a unpertected manner.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Of course you needn’t blab about it; but
I’ll have a loaded revolver, and if the rascals
come, I’ll show them that I know how to protect
myself.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Gettin’ in a big hurry, indade!” chuckled
Phelim, as he trudged on again. “He don’t
know what fer.”</p>

<p class='c009' >There was a meeting of the band of villains
that night, when all was arranged for the carrying
out of O’Rourke’s atrocious designs upon
the old farmer.</p>

<p class='c009' >The next morning, as Himes and his wife
rose from the breakfast-table, a big, burly German
presented himself before the open kitchen
door.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Goot tay, mynheer,” he said, touching his
cap; “I vas shoost looking for a chob ov vork,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_99' id='Page_99'>99</a></span>
to makes te monish to pay for de wittles and
de clo’es. I vil do anytings you vil haf to be
tun.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Himes asked a few questions as to his qualifications
for the work of raft-making and the
wages he expected, and receiving satisfactory
replies, engaged him at once.</p>

<p class='c009' >As Himes stepped out into the dooryard,
having directed the new-comer to take a seat at
the table, and Belinda set his breakfast before
him, a sly wink let her into the secret that here
was one of the accomplices of the would-be
assassin of her husband.</p>

<p class='c009' >She started, and turned pale; but averting
her eyes, went on silently with her work, though
her heart beat fast with terror and was heavy
with remorse, yet not with a repentance that
would lead her to draw back, ere it was too
late, from her promised share in the commission
of the fearful crime.</p>

<p class='c009' >Her heart did relent more than once during
the intervening time, and she was again and
again on the point of giving the old man a hint
of his danger. But then how to do so without
compromising Phelim’s safety, and even her
own, she could not see; and besides Himes
treated her in the presence of these strange men
(for Phelim arrived in the course of the morning,
bringing McManus with him) with scorn,
contempt, and lordly assumption of authority
which deeply humiliated her, and kindled
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_100' id='Page_100'>100</a></span>
anew the smouldering fires of hatred and revenge
that burned in her breast. There were
stolen interviews with Phelim, too, in which
he artfully added fuel to the flame, and thus
kept her to her resolve.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008' >At length all was done—the raft finished, all
the goods and chattels belonging to the
ill-assorted pair placed upon it, and they fully
prepared for their voyage.</p>

<p class='c009' >It was past noon when they found themselves
in this state of readiness, and the question was
raised whether it would not be the wiser plan
to remain where they were until morning, and
begin the journey with the new day.</p>

<p class='c009' >Kindly offers of hospitable entertainment
were made by more than one neighbor, but
Mr. Himes refused to consent to the least delay.
They could travel several miles before
sundown, he said, and it would be just so much
gained.</p>

<p class='c009' >This suited the conspirators exactly. McManus
had been engaged to assist in propelling
the raft; he would see that it was moored for
the night at a spot which they had selected as
well fitted to be the scene of their intended
crime—a lonely and secluded place some six or
seven miles down the river.</p>

<p class='c009' >Belinda stumbled in stepping aboard, and
had nearly fallen into the water.</p>

<p class='c009' >“The very awkwardest critter I ever see!”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_102' id='Page_102'>102</a></span>
was the sneering remark of her husband, as he
caught her by the arm and saved her from a
wetting.</p>

<p class='c009' >Phelim, standing near, muttered a curse
under his breath, but the woman bore the rebuke
in silence. A vision of her reprover lying
there stiff and stark, with fast glazing eyes and
gray hairs all dabbled in blood, seemed to come
before her, and she had no heart to resent his
unkindness—could scarce refrain even now
from shrieking out to him to beware of these
men, for they were seeking his life.</p>

<p class='c009' >She sat pale and trembling while they loosed
from the shore and dropped slowly down the
stream, McManus laughing and exchanging
coarse jests with his intended victim, while his
two accomplices waved their hats, cheered the
departing voyagers, and shouting good-bye,
turned and walked rapidly away in the direction
of the highroad.</p>

<p class='c009' >Belinda followed them with her eyes till distance
and intervening trees shut out the sight;
then, utterly oblivious of everything but her
own guilty, miserable thoughts and fears, dropped
her face into her hands with a shudder and
a sigh that was half a moan.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Frettin’ arter that there handsome young
Irishman, be ye, eh?” sneered Himes’s voice
close at her side. “Well, ye needn’t; ye won’t
never see him no more. I begun to suspect,
this last day or two, that ye had most too big a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_103' id='Page_103'>103</a></span>
likin’ fer each other, and I’ll look out that he
don’t git near ye again.”</p>

<p class='c009' >She made no reply, nor even lifted her head;
and after regarding her a moment with silent
scorn, he walked away to the other side of the
raft.</p>

<p class='c009' >Subsequently he twitted her several times on
her excessive pallor, her silence and abstraction,
attributing them to the fright of her narrow
escape from falling into the river, and telling
her she was an arrant coward, even for a
woman.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Oh, do let me alone!” she said at length,
wearily. “You seem determined to make me
hate the very sight of you, the very sound of
your voice.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“And what do I care if you do?” he returned,
with a mocking laugh; “you can’t get
away from me, and I ain’t afeard o’ you.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Go away! go away!” she cried, covering
her ears with her hands and turning her back
upon him, while she shuddered from head to
foot and her face grew ghastly in the dim light,
for the sun had set and darkness was slowly
creeping over the earth.</p>

<p class='c009' >He lighted his pipe, turned from her with an
air of supreme indifference, and passing around
to the farther side of the rude cabin, which occupied
the centre of the raft, sat down for the
smoke with which he was accustomed to finish
the day, little dreaming that it might be his last.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_104' id='Page_104'>104</a></span>
She sat where he had left her, with her
elbows on her knees, her face in her hands, her
mind in a tumult of horror, fear, and remorse,
mingled with an intense hatred and disgust
toward him, the man to whose destiny she had
voluntarily linked her own for life.</p>

<p class='c009' >But she could not contemplate without a
shudder the cruel fate awaiting him. “Why
should he be slain?” she asked herself. Phelim
wanted her and the money; let him take both
and carry them away, but spare the old man’s
life—spare himself the staining of his hands
with innocent blood. The crime would be
great enough without that.</p>

<p class='c009' >The raft was now moored to the shore. She
lifted her head. How quiet everything was!
not a sound to break the almost oppressive stillness
save the slight ripple of the water at her
feet, and the evening song of the frogs. There
was not a house, road, fence, or any other sign
of man’s occupancy within sight, but on the top
of a slope not far away a solitary figure stood
out in relief against the sky for a single instant,
then vanished. They were there waiting for—what?
To murder an innocent old man in his
sleep, and possess themselves of his hard-earned
savings.</p>

<p class='c009' >Some one drew cautiously near and touched
her on the shoulder.</p>

<p class='c009' >“The byes is there,” whispered McManus,
“an’ ye mustn’t be afther betrayin’ us. I was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_105' id='Page_105'>105</a></span>
feart more’n oncet yer white face an’ shakin’
hands ud give ’im warnin’. Ye know we ain’t
a goin’ to harrum ye—no, niver a bit av it. He
thrates ye loike a brute baste, he does, the raskil;
but Phalim ull be good till ye, an’ mak’ ye
a rich lady wan o’ these days. I’m a goin’ to
lie down and slape a bit, an’ ye’d betther thry
the same, fer they’ll not be comin’ till toward
mornin’, whan folks slapes the soundest. Ye’ll
moind ye don’t do nothin’ to rouse the ould
man’s suspicions!”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I hate him! You may trust me,” she answered,
in low, husky tones, without lifting her
head or looking round.</p>

<p class='c009' >He went away, and again she was left to the
companionship of her own thoughts. Conscience
was loud in its upbraidings. What was
she doing? What would be the end of all this?
Even should she escape the strong hand of the
law, would not the spectre of the old man with
his gray locks all dabbled in blood haunt her all
her life?</p>

<p class='c009' >And he had been good to her once—before
she alienated his affections by her slatternly,
careless ways and indifference to his comfort.</p>

<p class='c009' >She could not look upon his death; she must
make an effort to save him, but without betraying
his would-be assassins. She rose and crept
around to the place where he sat. She crouched
at his side.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Don’t let us stay here to-night,” she said,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_106' id='Page_106'>106</a></span>
in a hoarse whisper; “let us go ashore and get
lodging in some house. You have money, and
those burglars may have got a hint of it; they
always do find out somehow, and they may
come on us in the night and—”</p>

<p class='c009' >He interrupted her. “There! I knowed ye
was a coward; but I’m not. Let ’em come.
I’m ready for ’em.”</p>

<p class='c009' >She drew away from him in discouragement
and disgust. Where was the use of trying to
save so besotted a fool—one who seemed bent
on his own destruction? If he perished that
night by the hand of violence, it would not be
her fault. She had done all she could; for any
further effort, any plainer speech would expose
herself to suspicion and violence from him.</p>

<p class='c009' >She went back to her former station on the
other side of the raft, and resuming the old
posture, with her elbows on her knees and her
face in her hands, tried to steel herself to the
coming fate of the man who was so persistently
abusive to her.</p>

<p class='c009' >But in vain; it was too horrible; and she
could not forget that she had consented to it.
Yet what more could she do? Ah! could she
herself rob him before the burglars came, and
steal away with the money to Phelim, he
surely would consent to run away with her
and it, and leave the old dotard his life. Surely
it would be much the better plan for all; but
how to accomplish it? for Himes had his money
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_107' id='Page_107'>107</a></span>
in a belt which he wore day and night about his
waist.</p>

<p class='c009' >He had finished his pipe, and she heard him
retire to the cabin. When she thought sufficient
time had elapsed for him to be sound
asleep she crept softly in and stretched herself
by his side—for the last time! Oh, what an
awaking his would be! She could not sleep;
her heart beat almost to suffocation, and she
trembled like an aspen leaf.</p>

<p class='c009' >At length, when his perfect stillness and regular
breathing seemed to speak of profound slumber,
she cautiously put out her hand and
touched the belt.</p>

<p class='c009' >He started up instantly, asking, with an oath,
“What’s that fer? what are ye after? would
ye dare to rob me?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“No; why should I? ain’t I your wife?”
she asked, bitterly. “But I want you to take
it off and hide it somewhere. You’d better lose
yer money than it and yer life too. If they
come they’ll have it at all costs; and if it’s on
you, they’ll kill you to get it.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“’Twon’t be no great loss to you if they do;
you’d like to be a gay young widder—you
needn’t deny it,” he said, with a sneer. “I’ll
resk it, anyhow; and don’t you touch my belt
agin.”</p>

<p class='c009' >It was her last effort to save him. Oh, how
long the hours seemed while she waited! yet
how gladly she would have detained them in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_108' id='Page_108'>108</a></span>
their flight, that thus the coming of the dreaded
event might be retarded.</p>

<p class='c009' >She had at last fallen into a doze when a hand
touched her, and Phelim’s voice whispered in
her ear, “Go! lave the ould divil to us; we’ll
take care o’ ’im. Run an’ give the alarum, but
don’t ye be in too big a hurry.”</p>

<p class='c009' >She was on her feet before he had finished his
sentence. Himes, too, had roused and started
up. She heard the two grapple with oaths and
curses as she dashed out of the cabin through
the midst of a group of dark forms that stepped
aside to let her pass, and sprang ashore.</p>

<p class='c009' >She ran a few paces, then paused for breath,
pressing her hand upon her wildly beating
heart. Her husband’s voice came to her in an
agonized shriek: “Help! help! murder! murder!”
with it the sharp report of a pistol, and
echoing the cry, she sped onward, fear, horror,
and remorse quickening her flight.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008' >At the time of the breaking out of the war for
the Union, Warren Charlton was a rising
young lawyer in Fairfield, a town situated, like
Prairieville, in Wild River Valley, but some
miles farther up the stream. On his return
from the war he had established himself in Prairieville,
much to the disgust and ire of Bangs,
who looked upon Charlton as a dangerous rival
in business, as also in love; and he was proving
himself such, building up a fine and lucrative
practice there and in the surrounding country.</p>

<p class='c009' >Some of his old clients still preferred him to
his successors in Fairfield, and when they had
important business requiring legal advice, would
come to or send for him to attend to it.</p>

<p class='c009' >And Dr. Jasper, having attained to the reputation
of being the most skilful physician and
surgeon in all that region of country, was not
infrequently summoned thither, and to other
like distant points, in cases of severe sickness
or serious accident.</p>

<p class='c009' >On the morning of the day that saw the embarkation
of Mr. and Mrs. Himes, both these
gentlemen had received an urgent call to the
vicinity of Fairfield. A man of property had
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_110' id='Page_110'>110</a></span>
been thrown from his carriage and seriously injured.
His recovery was doubtful, and a will
was to be made, while at the same time every
effort put forth to save his life.</p>

<p class='c009' >The town was not on the line of the railroad,
nor was the residence of Mr. Connor, the injured
man. It lay beyond Fairfield and near
the river. So the two gentlemen drove over
together.</p>

<p class='c009' >They found the patient dangerously hurt, but
in full possession of his mental powers. Physician
and lawyer were in attendance upon him
together or by turns through the remainder of
that day and the following night.</p>

<p class='c009' >Toward morning he slept under the influence
of an opiate administered to deaden the sense of
pain. Then the doctor withdrew from the
room, leaving him in the care of his wife and
daughter, and passing out upon the front porch,
joined the captain, who was slowly pacing it to
and fro.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Any change?” Charlton asked, stopping in
his walk.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes, for the better; I have strong hope
that he will recover. How are you progressing
with your work?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I have finished; nothing is wanting now
but Mr. Connor’s signature.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I think he will be able to add it when he
wakes,” the doctor said; “he is sleeping now.
Hark! what was that?”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_111' id='Page_111'>111</a></span>
“A pistol shot and a cry for help!” exclaimed
the captain. “It came from the direction
of the river, did it not? Some one is, perhaps,
in deadly peril. Let us go to the rescue.
I have a loaded revolver on the table in the
room yonder. It’s hardly safe to be without one
in these times of continual burglaries.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“No; I carry one constantly in travelling
about the country roads,” the doctor said; and
as the words left his lips two young men belonging
to the family came rushing out, excitedly,
but with care to make no noise.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Did you gentlemen hear that shot and cry
for help?” they asked, one of them adding,
“That band of burglars is after old Himes and
his money, I’m afraid. I heard he’d started
down the river on a raft and moored for the
night about half a mile below here.”</p>

<p class='c009' >There was a hasty consultation and gathering
up of weapons; then the four set off on a run
for the river, intending to follow its course till
they should reach the probable scene of conflict.</p>

<p class='c009' >But before they had traversed half the distance
a woman came rushing wildly toward
them, shrieking for help.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Who? where? what?” they asked.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Mr. Himes—my husband!” she panted.
“Oh, make haste! they’re killing him!”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Show us the way,” said Dr. Jasper; “lead
on, and we’ll follow.”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_112' id='Page_112'>112</a></span>
She turned and retraced her steps, almost flying
over the ground, so that they had some
difficulty in keeping up with her.</p>

<p class='c009' >Day was faintly dawning in the east, and as
they neared the spot they could see the outlines
of the raft where it lay on the water, then
several dark figures leap ashore from it and fled
swiftly in a direction opposite to that from
which they were approaching.</p>

<p class='c009' >One of the young men sent a shot after them,
but without effect, the light being insufficient
for certain aim. All was darkness and silence
on the raft.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Oh, we’re too late! they’ve killed him!”
exclaimed Belinda, with a hysterical sob.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Perhaps not,” said the doctor, stepping cautiously
aboard, the others following. “Can
you get a light?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“There was a candle and matches on a
shelf in the cabin there, close to the door,” she
answered, in a shaking voice. “Get them
yourselves; I can’t go in there to look at—”</p>

<p class='c009' >“No need; here they are,” he said, in a low,
excited tone, having already stepped to the
door and laid his hand upon them.</p>

<p class='c009' >He struck a match, lighted the candle, and
glanced about the tiny apartment, the other
men pressing up behind him and looking over
his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c009' >A shudder ran through the little group, and
a low exclamation of horror burst from the lips
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_113' id='Page_113'>113</a></span>
of the young Connors; but the doctor and the
captain, inured to scenes of blood and carnage
by their experiences in the late war, viewed
this one in awed silence. Yet only for an instant.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Life may not be extinct!” exclaimed the
doctor, hastily setting down the light and stooping
over the prostrate, bleeding, and apparently
lifeless form of the old man.</p>

<p class='c009' >Belinda, lingering on the outside of the
group, overheard the words with strangely
mingled relief and terror. To think that he
had been murdered was so horrible; yet if he
were still alive and should recover consciousness
and the power of speech! Ah, who could
tell how much he knew or would be able to reveal
of her complicity in the crime? Trembling
and half fainting with fright she clutched
at the wall of the cabin to keep from falling.</p>

<p class='c009' >Her first impulse was to flee; but a second
thought told her that would but confirm the
suspicion of her guilt, were such once set afloat,
while if she remained and bore herself with an
air of innocence, the fact that she had promptly
summoned assistance would be strong evidence
in her favor.</p>

<p class='c009' >She dropped down upon the floor, and leaning
her head against the wall, listened intently
for further sounds from within, though her
heart was beating so loud that it seemed as if
she could hear nothing else.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_114' id='Page_114'>114</a></span>
“He lives! he is reviving!” were the next
words that reached her ear after what had
seemed hours of waiting, though in reality but
a very few moments had passed.</p>

<p class='c009' >Then the old man spoke, feebly, tremulously,
but quite distinctly. “He thought he’d finished
me, the scoundrel! Run, somebody, and
catch him! It’s Phelim O’Rourke; he’s robbed
me! he’s got it all!” feeling for the belt he had
worn about his waist. “And she—she’s hand
and glove with him—curse her! take her too,
and let the law deal with ’em both!”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Who?” asked one of the bystanders.</p>

<p class='c009' >“B’lindy—my Judas of a wife! She’s betrayed
me into the hands o’ them burglars.”</p>

<p class='c009' >He paused, panting for breath, while the doctor
said, soothingly, “I think you are mistaken.
She has saved your life by bringing us here to
your aid.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Humph!” grunted the old man, incredulously.
Then, impatiently, and struggling to
rise, “Why don’t ye run and ketch the robbers,
some o’ ye? they’ll git away with every
cent I had.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“It shall be attended to,” said the doctor;
“but you must stop talking, if you want to live
to bring them to justice.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I’m off after the sheriff and a posse of men
to pursue them as fast as possible!” cried one
of the young men, springing ashore.</p>

<p class='c009' >His brother was about to follow, but the doctor
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_115' id='Page_115'>115</a></span>
detained him. “We must have help to
carry Mr. Himes to some place where he can
have the care and nursing he is likely to need
for days or weeks to come.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“He’ll have to be taken on a litter?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes, certainly; he is too weak for any other
mode of conveyance.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I’ll see to it; I’ll have two or three more
men here before I’m an hour older, or my
name’s not Bob Connor!” and away he sped
toward the town.</p>

<p class='c009' >Charlton stepped out from the cabin, leaving
Dr. Jasper alone with the wounded man.</p>

<p class='c009' >At the sound of his step Belinda lifted her
head. “Is there anything I can do to help,
sir?” she asked, in a shaking voice.</p>

<p class='c009' >“I think not,” he replied; “and I should
judge it best for you to keep out of his sight for
a while, as the excitement of seeing you might
prove injurious.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes, I s’pose so,” she said, gloomily, and
averting her face. “Where’ll he be took to?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“The tavern in Fairfield, I presume; I know
of no more suitable place—do you?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“No; we hain’t got no home no more. I
told him ’twas a fool thing to sell it; but of
course he thought I didn’t know nothin’; but
if he’d done as I said, this awful thing wouldn’t
never a happened.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“No, I presume not; and I think myself it
was a foolhardy thing to attempt to go down
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_116' id='Page_116'>116</a></span>
the river in this way, particularly with such a
sum of money on board, and in the face of the
fact that so many burglaries have been committed
in the neighborhood of late.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I wisht he a been wiser,” she sighed,
dropping her face into her hands; “but I’ll
nurse him out o’ this ov he’ll let me.”</p>

<p class='c009' >The captain suggested that she could at least
gather up his clothing and such other things as
would be needed for his comfort while ill.</p>

<p class='c009' >She said she would stay behind and do so when
they carried him away, then follow to the hotel
with the things; she knew the way quite well.</p>

<p class='c009' >“You were by when the attack was made?”
Charlton presently remarked, interrogatively.
“I hope you may be able to testify to the identity
of the would-be murderers?”</p>

<p class='c009' >She started and trembled afresh. “I—I
didn’t see one o’ their faces,” she said. “How
could I? ’twas dark as pitch.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“O’Rourke was employed by Mr. Himes for
several weeks, I know; and you may have
been able to recognize his voice.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“He—I mean the fellar that come in the cabin
where we was sleepin’—didn’t say a word, only
grabbed Himes—to git a holt o’ the belt he kep’
his money in, I s’pose—and Himes he begun to
screech murder! an’ I cut an’ run fer help hard
as ever I could,” she said, in a sullen tone.
“He kin say whatsomever he’s a mind to; I
hadn’t nothin’ to do with the affair.”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_117' id='Page_117'>117</a></span>
“I hope not, indeed,” returned the captain;
“and I trust you will be ready to do what you
can to bring the scoundrels to justice.”</p>

<p class='c009' >She made no response to that, but presently
rose and went around to the other side of the
raft, where she remained out of sight till the
wounded man had been carried away.</p>

<p class='c009' >The town, situated a mile or more farther
up the river, could be reached by traversing
half that distance by land. Taking that
route, Mr. Himes’s bearers bore him thither,
stepping carefully to avoid jolting him.</p>

<p class='c009' >The news of the attack upon him had spread
like wildfire, and early as was the hour, the
streets were full of people—men, women, and
children—eager to catch a glimpse of his features
as he was carried past, and to learn every
particular of the affair. Many of them, falling
into line behind the litter, followed it to the
outer door of the tavern, and would have even
pressed into the room to which he was finally
taken had not the doctor positively forbidden it
and resolutely shut the door in their faces.</p>

<p class='c009' >All was still excitement in and about the
building when the stage from Frederic drove
up.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Stop here for breakfast,” the driver called
out, laconically, to his passengers as he reined
in his horses and sprang to the ground. Then
holding the lines in one hand, he opened the
door of the stage with the other.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_118' id='Page_118'>118</a></span>
Several men alighted, one of them hailing the
landlord:</p>

<p class='c009' >“Hello, Strong, what’s up?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Why, hello, Smith! how d’y do?” returned
mine host, stepping briskly forward and
shaking hands. “Glad to see you. But haven’t
ye heard the news? Old Farmer Himes, simpleton
that he was to be travelling down the
river on a raft, was attacked by the burglars
last night—or, rather, early this morning I suppose
it was—and pretty nigh murdered. Dr.
Jasper’s been working with him for the last two
hours; he’s in there now,” nodding his head
in the direction of the room where the wounded
man lay, “but I reckon he’ll bring him round.”</p>

<p class='c009' >A stranger standing at Smith’s side started
slightly at the mention of the doctor’s name,
and, fixing his eyes on the speaker, listened intently
as he went on to give a detailed account
of the nature and extent of Himes’s hurts, and
what had been done for his relief. “Ah, here
comes the doc himself!” he exclaimed, pausing
in his narrative as a gentleman stepped from the
doorway into their midst. “How’s your patient,
doc?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Doing as well as could reasonably be expected,
Mr. Strong,” returned Dr. Jasper,
quietly, but as one in some haste. “Not well
enough for me to leave him to-day,” he added,
“and I must send a telegram to my wife, lest
she should be anxious at not seeing me.”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_119' id='Page_119'>119</a></span>
“Got it ready, I see,” said Strong, noticing
that the doctor held a slip of paper in his fingers.
“Just give it to me, and I’ll have it sent
right away. Now walk in to breakfast, gentlemen—all
of you; it’s on the table, smoking
hot.”</p>

<p class='c009' >All this time the stranger had eyed Dr. Jasper
askance, and now taking a seat nearly opposite
him at the table, he continued to do so
during the meal.</p>

<p class='c009' >The doctor did not seem to perceive the
scrutiny to which he was being subjected, but
ate as one whose thoughts were preoccupied
with something else than his immediate surroundings
or the food of which he was partaking.</p>

<p class='c009' >Naturally the talk at the table ran principally
on the startling event of a few hours previous;
but the doctor took no part in it, except when
directly addressed by remark or query.</p>

<p class='c009' >Presently the announcement, “Stage for
Prairieville leaves in five minutes!” sent several
persons, including the stranger who had so
persistently eyed the doctor, hurrying out.</p>

<p class='c009' >Dr. Jasper rose the next moment, and was
passing through the hall on his way to his patient,
when the driver slammed the door to
upon his passengers, the stranger leaning eagerly
forward to catch a last glimpse of the physician.</p>

<p class='c009' >“You appear to take considerable interest in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_120' id='Page_120'>120</a></span>
Dr. Jasper, sir,” remarked Smith, eyeing the
man with a quizzical look, as the driver vaulted
to his elevated seat and took up the reins.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes; I’ve heard him spoken of,” was the
reply.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Nothing bad, I’ll venture to say; he’s well
thought of in these parts,” remarked Smith,
with emphasis.</p>

<p class='c009' >But the stranger was gazing from the window,
as they whirled rapidly down the street,
and paid no attention to the remark.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008' >It was a bright June morning, redolent of the
breath of roses and honeysuckle in full
bloom, sweet with the songs of birds; and nowhere
sweeter or lovelier than at Lakeside,
where gentle breezes sighed in the tree-tops and
glad sunbeams danced on the waters of the lake.</p>

<p class='c009' >The grandmother’s face expressed placid contentment
as she went about her daily round of
household duties; Ronald was in almost gay
spirits, averring that he had not felt so well at
any time before since receiving his wounds;
the children were full of mirth and jollity, running
hither and thither about the garden and
lawn, gathering flowers for the parlor vases,
feeding the chickens, hunting eggs in the barn,
and doing various little services for the older
members of the family. Their sister noticed
their efforts with smiles and words of commendation,
talked cheerfully, even gayly, to
her grandmother and Ronald, and went about
attending to her many duties and responsibilities
in her usual prompt and energetic fashion;
yet her heart was heavy and her cheek pale.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Miriam, dear child,” Mrs. Heath said at
length, “you are not well.”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_122' id='Page_122'>122</a></span>
“I’m not sick, granny dear,” was the smiling
rejoinder; “a slight headache is all that ails
me, and a walk will relieve it, I think; so, as a
few things are wanted from the stores, and I
can be spared from the field, I’m going into
town.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“That’s right,” responded her grandmother;
“and don’t hurry yourself, for it’s early, and
you’ll have plenty of time to walk leisurely—to
call on Mrs. Jasper, too; and I wish you
would, for we haven’t heard or seen anything
of her or the doctor for some days.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I shall if I have time, grandma,” replied
Miriam, drawing on her gloves—for she had
just entered the room attired for her walk. “I
am very fond of Serena, as you know, and a
talk with her is always a real treat.”</p>

<p class='c009' >She did her errands first, then turned in the
direction of Dr. Jasper’s pretty vine-covered
and rose-embowered cottage.</p>

<p class='c009' >Serena met her at the door, gave her a warm
embrace, and seated her in an arm-chair on the
shaded porch, taking another by her side.</p>

<p class='c009' >At their feet lay the little garden, gay with
flowers, that separated the house from the
street. Perry was amusing himself there
trundling a toy wheelbarrow up and down the
walks. He dropped it to run to Miriam to
claim a kiss, asking eagerly if Bertie and Olly
were coming, too.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Not to-day, my little man,” Miriam said,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_123' id='Page_123'>123</a></span>
bestowing the caress, and keeping her arm
about him. “How is little sister?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Oh, dus splendid!” he exclaimed, his dark
eyes dancing with pleasure; “her’s de nicest
’ittle sister ever was.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“He’s very fond of her,” Serena remarked,
with satisfaction. “And she is a lovely little
darling, if her father and mother are competent
to judge of her charms,” she added, with her
low, silvery laugh.</p>

<p class='c009' >“And am I not to be treated to a sight of
her?” asked Miriam, lightly.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes, indeed. She is taking her morning
nap; but I think we can take a peep at her
ladyship without waking her,” Serena said, rising,
and leading the way through the hall to
the cosey sitting-room beyond, where, in a
dainty crib, the babe lay sleeping—a plump, fair,
golden-haired, blue-eyed little creature some
three months old.</p>

<p class='c009' >“What a darling!” exclaimed Miriam, half
under her breath as the two bent over the little
one with eyes full of loving admiration.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Isn’t she? the dear, tiny, helpless thing!”
murmured Serena, just touching her lips to the
velvet cheek. “Ah, Miriam dear, how happy
I am!” she sighed, when they had gone back
to the porch and resumed their seats. “I
couldn’t wish anything better for you than such
a wifehood and motherhood as mine: two such
darling children, and a husband so tenderly
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_124' id='Page_124'>124</a></span>
careful of his wife, so kind and affectionate as
mine.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I am very glad for you, Serena,” Miriam
said in reply. “I think you have won a prize
in the matrimonial lottery; but I can scarcely
expect to do so well; therefore, my better plan
will be to remain single.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Oh, no, indeed you must not! I am very
sure you can do—perhaps not quite, but very
nearly as well, if you choose,” returned Serena,
with a laughing glance into her friend’s face.
“He’s deeply in love, Mirry; there’s no doubt
about it; the doctor and I have both seen it for
some time past.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“You are talking in riddles,” Miriam said,
smiling and blushing in spite of herself. Then
a look of keen distress came into her face.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Mirry, you are in trouble,” Serena said,
taking her friend’s hand and squeezing it affectionately
in her own. “Tell me what it is,
dear, and let me sympathize, and help, too, if I
can.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I came, intending to tell you,” faltered
Miriam, “and to ask advice of the doctor—not
professional; but it’s partly a business matter,
and I can’t bear to speak of it to Ronald or
Sandy; though, indeed, I cannot—oh, it would
be impossible!—I never, never could; there is,
after all, but one course open to me; and yet—and
yet—”</p>

<p class='c009' >“What is it, dear?” asked Serena, as Miriam
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_125' id='Page_125'>125</a></span>
broke off abruptly, hiding her face in her hands,
while the hot blood mounted to her very hair.
“If it’s anything Alonzo can help you in, he
will do it most gladly, I am sure. He’s away
for to-day at Fairfield, or near there; I expected
him home this morning, but had a telegram
awhile ago saying he couldn’t leave a very sick
patient till to-morrow. Oh,” arriving at an
inkling of the truth by a sudden intuition, “it’s
that horrid Bangs! I know it is! Have him?
No, of course you couldn’t! ’twould be worse
than death by far!”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes, Serena; oh, a thousand times worse!”
Miriam exclaimed, dropping her hands and fixing
anguished eyes on her friend’s face. “But
oh, you don’t know what mischief—not to me
only, but to those dearer than myself—he now
has it in his power to do!”</p>

<p class='c009' >“What, Mirry? what can he have it in his
power to do to you in this free country?”
queried Serena, both look and tone expressing
surprise and dismay, along with some slight
incredulity.</p>

<p class='c009' >“He holds a mortgage on Lakeside; and as
I am not able to meet even the full interest at
present, he can foreclose and rob us of the home
our father made for us—the dear home where
we were all born, and where father and mother
died. Is not that a hard alternative?” Miriam
asked, hot tears streaming from her eyes.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Dreadful! dreadful! But has he actually
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_126' id='Page_126'>126</a></span>
threatened it? has he presumed to offer himself
to you? He who isn’t fit to wipe the dust
from your shoes!” she added, in wrathful accents.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes; he has done both,” sighed Miriam;
then went on to tell of an interview held with
Bangs on the previous afternoon in the grove
adjacent to the house at Lakeside.</p>

<p class='c009' >Feeling entitled to an hour of recreation,
after many spent in overseeing the men in the
field, and attending to domestic duties about the
house, she had gone to the grove with a book,
and while pleasingly absorbed in its contents had
been surprised by a visit from Bangs, who, in
spite of a reception of studied coldness, had
forced his society upon her and made her an
offer of his hand, professing to have already bestowed
his heart upon her.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Heart, indeed!” exclaimed Serena, in hot
indignation; “he doesn’t own anything worthy
of the name. I hope you told him so.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Not exactly that,” Miriam said, with the
ghost of a smile; “but my reply was as unequivocal
and decided a rejection of his suit as
I knew how to make it. Then he grew furious,
and haughtily informed me that he would find
means to compel me to accept him or he would
ruin the whole family, as he had bought the
mortgage from Mr. Himes, and could foreclose
when he pleased.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Himes!” exclaimed Serena. “Oh, did you
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_127' id='Page_127'>127</a></span>
hear the news that was telegraphed from Fairfield
this morning?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“No; what was it?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“That Mr. Himes was attacked on his raft
shortly before daylight, robbed, and nearly
murdered.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Oh, how dreadful! But he was not quite
killed?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“No; he was insensible when found; but
they succeeded in restoring him to consciousness,
so that he was able to tell that his robber
and intended murderer was that Phelim
O’Rourke who was suspected of committing
the Lakeside burglary, but cleared by Bangs
swearing to an <i>alibi</i>. I don’t believe a word of
that <i>alibi</i>, and never did; and now hope that
they will get the rascal into custody and find
some of your marked notes on him or in his
possession somewhere.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Miriam drew a long breath. “Oh, if that
should happen!” she cried, “I—I think it
would help me to get out of Bangs’s power.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I do believe it would!” exclaimed Serena,
her eyes sparkling at the thought. “But
whether that happens or not, Alonzo is sure to
find a way of escape for you. Miriam, he’s the
best and kindest-hearted man that ever was
made. I used to think I was fond of Perry’s
father—Perry Golding, Sr.—but it was nothing
to compare to my love for his successor.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I am so glad,” Miriam said, smiling sympathetically
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_128' id='Page_128'>128</a></span>
into the speaker’s eyes, “for the doctor
is worthy of all the love you can give him,
and it makes you both so happy. You have
never told me anything about Mr. Golding.
He was killed in the war—in battle—was he
not?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“No; he joined the Confederate army in
spite of the strongest opposition on my part,
and after a while I had word that he was sick in
a hospital down in Alabama, and though I hurried
there as fast as possible, he was dead before
my arrival—dead and buried; they showed
me his grave, and gave me his clothes, but
wouldn’t let me remove the body.</p>

<p class='c009' >“I went home in deep grief, for I had been
quite attached to poor Perry. But he wasn’t
the man Dr. Jasper is; he would get drunk
occasionally, and then be cross and unreasonable;
sometimes actually abusive.”</p>

<p class='c009' >She broke off with a sudden exclamation,
“Oh, see what a crowd is coming down the
street! I wonder what it means?”</p>

<p class='c009' >They sprang to their feet and stood gazing
intently at an approaching party of horsemen,
followed by a motley crowd of men and boys
on foot.</p>

<p class='c009' >As they drew near enough for the recognition
of faces, Miriam remarked, in a low tone, to
her companion, “That is Mr. Duncan, the
county sheriff, riding at the head; and he has a
prisoner in charge. Can it be?—yes, yes, it is
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_129' id='Page_129'>129</a></span>
Phelim O’Rourke! Oh, how thankful I am
that they have caught him—the would-be murderer
of that poor old man!”</p>

<p class='c009' >“So am I; but why do they bring him here?
Why not take him to Fairfield? so much nearer
as it is to the place where he did the dreadful
deed.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Because this is the county town, and the jail
is here. He richly deserves hanging; but
capital punishment has been abolished in this
State. Besides, if his victim doesn’t die it
wouldn’t be a hanging matter in any State—ought
not to be, of course.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“There’ll be a trial, anyhow,” remarked
Serena, “and Bangs will, I presume, do his
best to defend the scoundrel again; but I hope
he will not be able to save him from the penitentiary.”</p>

<p class='c009' >The crowd had passed, and Miriam found it
was time for her to go home. The friends
parted affectionately, Serena exhorting Miriam
to be brave and cheerful, for the doctor would
surely find a way to help her out of her trouble.</p>

<p class='c009' >Miriam walked briskly on, hardly looking to
the right or left, for her thoughts were very
busy with her personal difficulties and the
startling events of the morning. So it was a
surprise when she was suddenly addressed by
a man’s voice speaking in gentlemanly accents,
“Excuse me, madam, but can you direct me to
the house of Dr. Jasper?” and turning her head,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_130' id='Page_130'>130</a></span>
perceived a stranger standing, hat in hand, by
her side.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes,” she said; “it is that pretty house
yonder, on the other side of the street, nearly
two squares below here, and with roses and
honeysuckle climbing over the front porch.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Thank you,” he returned, with a low bow,
and hurried away in the direction indicated.</p>

<p class='c009' >“I wonder who he is?” thought Miriam,
sending a backward glance after the retreating
figure. “Somebody wanting the doctor, I suppose.
Dear me! why didn’t I think to tell him
that he is out of town and will not return till
to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c009' >It was too late for that now, so she dismissed
the stranger from her thoughts and hastened on
her way, feeling that she had already lingered
too long.</p>

<p class='c009' >Perry had gone back to his play, and Serena
was still seated in the porch, with a bit of sewing
in her hand, stitching industriously and
softly humming a snatch of song in the fulness
of her content and joy in the thought of her
loved husband and two darling children, when
the gate opened, and lifting her head at the
sound, she saw a tall man of military bearing
stride in, snatch up Perry, and give him a vigorous
hug and kiss.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Don’t, man! oo dus et me be!” cried the
little fellow, struggling to release himself.</p>

<p class='c009' >Setting him on his feet again, the stranger
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_131' id='Page_131'>131</a></span>
passed quickly up the porch steps and stood before
Serena. She glanced up into his bearded
face in surprised inquiry, sprang to her feet,
and stepped back a pace or two, her heart beating
wildly, the color suffusing her face, then
suddenly retreating, and leaving it of a death-like
pallor.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Don’t you know me?” he asked, with a
slightly scornful curl of the lip.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes,” she answered, slowly, her voice
trembling with agitation; “it’s—George Golding,
the brother of my former husband, Perry’s
father.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“No; it’s not George, but Perry himself.
I’m your husband, Serena, and you’re my wife.
My claim is stronger than Jasper’s, and he’ll
have to give you up to me.”</p>

<p class='c009' >A look of anguish swept over her wan face,
and she clutched at a chair-back for support.</p>

<p class='c009' >“It isn’t true,” she said, hoarsely; “it can’t
be true, for Perry Golding died three years ago.
I went to the hospital to nurse him, but he was
dead before I got there; they told me so, and
they showed me his grave and gave me his
clothes.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“’Twas all a lie, then,” he asserted, “for
here I am, alive and well, and I’ve come for my
wife, and intend to have her, too—her and my
son.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I’ll not go with you!” she cried, the color
returning to her cheek and her eyes flashing
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_132' id='Page_132'>132</a></span>
with anger. “I tell you my former husband is
dead, and you—you are an impostor!”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Am I?” he said, coolly, helping himself to
a chair. “Sit down and listen to what I have
to say in proof of my identity.”</p>

<p class='c009' >She dropped into her seat again, and he went
on to speak of some things known only to him
and herself. He succeeded in convincing her;
she knew and acknowledged that he was the
husband she had so long believed to be in his
grave, so long ceased to mourn, but it was with
bitter sobs and tears that she did so; she drew
herself away when he would have embraced
her, and bade him leave her—at least for the
present.</p>

<p class='c009' >Perry had joined them, and stood by his
mother’s side, glancing wonderingly from one
to the other. Presently he doubled up his fist
and shook it in his father’s face. “Go ’way,
bad man!” he said, fiercely; “oo make my
mamma cry. Go ’way! I’ll tell my papa on
oo, and he’ll whip oo!”</p>

<p class='c009' >“He’ll have a big job on his hands if he attempts
that,” Golding said, regarding the little
fellow with an amused smile. “But I’m your
papa, my man.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“No, oo ain’t!” cried the child, backing
away as he would have taken him by the hand.</p>

<p class='c009' >Just then an infant’s cry came from within
the house</p>

<p class='c009' >“There! oo’ve waked the baby—my ’ittle
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_133' id='Page_133'>133</a></span>
sister—oo bad ole man! Go ’way dis minute!”
cried Perry, with a stamp of his baby
foot, while Serena rose hurriedly, ran into the
sitting-room, snatched her babe from its crib,
and, straining it to her breast, turned and faced
Golding, who had followed her in.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yours?” he queried, with an angry flush
on his cheek.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes, mine,” she said, firmly, soothing it
with tenderest caresses; “my own precious
darling.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Jasper’s brat, eh? She’ll have to be left
behind when you go with me.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Then I’ll never go with you! Leave my
baby, indeed! never, never while I draw the
breath of life!”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Now, see here, Serena,” he said, in a tone
of expostulation, “you know you’re not Jasper’s
wife, and can’t be while I live.”</p>

<p class='c009' >She turned on him fiercely. “What right
had you to go away and leave me for three
years to believe you dead and buried? If you
had ever written me a line or sent a message
even by some one else, this would never have
happened. You are responsible for it all, and
you have no right to claim me now. Where
have you been all these years?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“In Mexico. I’ve made money enough to
enable us to live in comfort and even luxury,
and I thought to share it with you and our
boy.”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_134' id='Page_134'>134</a></span>
“Money!” she cried, with ineffable scorn;
“you would bribe me with money to leave this
darling,” gazing down at her babe with tear-dimmed
eyes, an expression of unspeakable love
and tenderness stealing over her features, “and—and
the husband who has been far, far more
tender and true than ever you were, Perry
Golding.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Not your husband, madam; he can’t be
that while I live; and now that you know that
I am living, you will leave him at once if you are
a—the virtuous woman I always took you to be.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Go! leave me this moment!” she cried,
imperiously. “You, and you alone, are to
blame for this dreadful state of things!”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I go,” he said, bowing himself out; “but
you and Jasper will hear from me again.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Oh, how cruel, how cruel he is!” she
sobbed, sinking into a low rocker. “He knew
I was married again; he had heard it; and why
couldn’t he stay away and leave me in peace?
Oh, it would break my heart to leave Alonzo,
and you, my precious, precious baby!” clasping
it close, and covering its face with kisses and
tears.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Don’t cry, mamma; the naughty man’s
gone,” said Perry, creeping to her side and
putting an arm around her neck; “don’t cry;
he sha’n’t come back any more; I’ll watch the
gate, and if I see him coming, I’ll run and lock
the door.”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_135' id='Page_135'>135</a></span>
“Oh, Perry, we can’t keep him out!” she
sighed, hugging and kissing the little prattler,
while the big tears rolled down her cheeks.
“What shall I do?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Send for papa to come right away.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“So I will,” she said, laying her babe in the
crib again, and going to her writing-desk.
“Run to the kitchen, Perry, dear, and tell Annie
I want her.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Taking a slip of paper from the desk, she
wrote a message:</p>

<p class='c009' >“Come home; I have urgent need of you.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Annie was at her side before the last word
was penned. The girl had overheard a part of
the interview between her mistress and the
stranger, and was full of excitement and curiosity.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Oh, Mrs. Jasper, what’s wrong?” she exclaimed.
“Was that one o’ them burglars
threatenin’ you? They’re gettin’ so bold, nobody
knows what they won’t do next.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“No; he was not a burglar,” Serena answered,
speaking with as entire composure as
she could command. “I want you to take this
slip of paper to the telegraph office and ask
them to send the message I have written on it
to Dr. Jasper, at Fairfield, as promptly as possible.
Here is the money to pay for it.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Mr. Himes had recovered sufficiently to be
told of the arrest of O’Rourke, with all the fruits
of the robbery of the raft in his possession; for
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_136' id='Page_136'>136</a></span>
so hot had been the pursuit that the villains
had found no opportunity for a division of the
spoils.</p>

<p class='c009' >The old man received the news with exultation,
declaring his intention to prosecute to the
utmost extent of the law, and at once engaged
Captain Charlton as his attorney.</p>

<p class='c009' >The latter was preparing to leave for Prairieville,
Dr. Jasper intending to remain behind till
the next day, when Serena’s telegram was handed
him. He could not imagine what was amiss
at home; but her assertion that she had urgent
need of him was sufficient to work an immediate
change in his plans. Consigning his Fairfield
patients to the care of another physician,
he drove back to Prairieville with Charlton,
and about the middle of the afternoon alighted
at his own door.</p>

<p class='c009' >Little Perry greeted him with a welcoming
shout. “Oh, papa, I’m so glad you’ve comed!
A naughty man comed here and made mamma
cry, and she doesn’t stop. But oo won’t let
him come any more; will oo, papa?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I shall certainly not allow anybody to
trouble mamma if I can help it, my boy,” returned
the doctor, hurrying into the house.</p>

<p class='c009' >Serena met him, all bathed in tears, and
threw herself sobbing into his arms.</p>

<p class='c009' >“My darling!” he exclaimed, in surprise and
concern, “what is wrong? what can have happened
to distress you so?”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_137' id='Page_137'>137</a></span>
“Oh, Alonzo, the worst, the very worst thing
you can imagine! Perry Golding is not dead—there
was some strange mistake; he is here;
in town; and—and he claims me as more his
than yours. But oh, I love you—only you; and
it will kill me if I have to go back to him!”</p>

<p class='c009' >“It is beyond belief!” he cried, aghast.
“Surely the fellow is an impostor!”</p>

<p class='c009' >“No; I thought so at first; but he proved
his identity to me beyond a doubt. Oh, tell
me, have I not a right to choose between you
and cling to the one I love best—the one who
will let me have both my children?—for he
would force me to leave my baby behind.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Then he is utterly unworthy of you!” exclaimed
the doctor, in hot indignation.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Then you will not let him tear me away
from you?” she sobbed, clinging closer to
him.</p>

<p class='c009' >“It would be like submitting to having my
heart torn out,” he groaned; “but oh, my
dear, I cannot yet see what can be done—how
I can rightfully ignore his claim to you, my
heart’s idol! Let me think,” he added, releasing
her from his embrace and beginning to pace
the floor.</p>

<p class='c009' >“He deserted me and left me for three years
to believe him dead and buried,” she said. “I
think I’ve heard that was considered sufficient
ground for divorce.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“According to man’s enactments, yes; but,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_138' id='Page_138'>138</a></span>
dearest,” gazing on her with a look of yearning
tenderness, “we who profess to be God’s followers
and children must abide by the law of
God, who permits divorce for but one cause.
Ah,” with a brightening countenance as a sudden
recollection came to him, “I do remember
now to have heard, before we left your old
home, that Perry Golding had given you that
one cause!”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Is it so?” she cried, half breathlessly. “I
had not known it, though I can well believe
it may have been true. Tell me about it,
please.”</p>

<p class='c009' >He did so.</p>

<p class='c009' >“And you will tell him?” she said, when he
had finished his story; “and surely he must
see at once that he has no longer any rightful
claim to me, and will go away and leave us in
peace.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“There will have to be a divorce,” replied
the doctor. “I hope he may be induced to join
in asking for it, in which case, if I am not very
much mistaken, the judge can grant it without
bringing the affair into court.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“And if he won’t join in the request?” she
asked, almost holding her breath to listen for
his reply.</p>

<p class='c009' >“You may have to sue for divorce, bringing
your proof of marital infidelity and desertion.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Oh, horrible!” she cried, shuddering, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_139' id='Page_139'>139</a></span>
hiding her face; “to have all that dragged before
the public!”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Dearest, do not distress yourself,” he said,
tenderly, and with emotion; “we will hope
that alternative may not be forced upon you.”</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008' >It was past noon when Belinda left the raft,
carrying a large basket containing her husband’s
clothes and such other articles as there
might be pressing need of for him or herself.
She hoped to make arrangements for storing
their goods in some safe place, and to return in
the course of the afternoon with a conveyance
for them, and some one to assist in their removal.</p>

<p class='c009' >She had not gone far when she met a farmer
driving leisurely along the road.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Good-day,” he called to her. “If I was
goin’ your way I’d give ye a lift; that basket
looks heavy; but I’m comin’ from the town and
you a goin’ toward it. Good deal of excitement
there to-day. Did ye hear the news?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“What news?” she asked, her heart leaping
into her mouth.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Why, that they’ve nabbed the murderer;
leastways, the scoundrel that attackted that old
man on the raft and left him fer dead. They’ve
took him to Prairieville to the jail. He’d ought
to be strung right up, I say; fer I’ve not the
least doubt that he’s at the head o’ the gang o’
burglars that’s been robbin’ here and there till
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_141' id='Page_141'>141</a></span>
nobody in this whole region of country knows
when he and his family and goods is safe.”</p>

<p class='c009' >He had reined in his horses, and she had set
down her basket for a moment’s rest while
listening to what he had to say.</p>

<p class='c009' >“But don’t you think everybody’d ought to
have a fair trial?” she asked, with some hesitation.</p>

<p class='c009' >“That’s so, when there’s any doubt o’ their
guilt and any chance o’ their gettin’ their deserts;
which, howsomever, there ain’t in this
instance, seein’ that the law’s so that they can’t
nohow mete out to the murderers the measure
they’ve meted to their victims; and that ain’t
accordin’ to Scriptur’, nohow you kin fix it,”
he said, flecking a fly off his horse’s back with
the lash of his whip. “There’s some folks that
talk as if ’twas worse than hangin’ to be shut up
in State’s prison fer life,” he went on, “but I
always notice that them that’s in favor of the
criminal is pretty generally o’ the opinion that
they’ve gained a good deal fer him when they
get a death sentence commuted to that; because,
you see, there’s always a chance o’ some
governor that wants to secure the votes o’ that
class pard’nin’ him out.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes; but it’s an awful thing to put a man
to death, because if you find out afterward that
he was innocent, you can’t make it up to him
nohow at all,” she said, taking up her basket;
and with a parting nod she went on her way.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_142' id='Page_142'>142</a></span>
On entering the town, she at once perceived
evidences of unusual excitement among the inhabitants:
men were grouped together on the
sidewalks and about the store doors, neighbor-women
talking across fences or leaning out of
windows, discussing the all-absorbing topic of
the robbery and attempted murder of old
Farmer Himes, and the arrest of the supposed
leader of the gang of burglars who had been for
months past the terror of Wild River Valley.</p>

<p class='c009' >Occasionally Belinda heard her own name
coupled with the remark that the old man believed
her to be in league with his would-be
assassins, the speaker or the one addressed
sometimes adding that she, too, ought to be
arrested and put in prison for trial.</p>

<p class='c009' >She hurried on her way, growing more and
more frightened at every step, till by the time
she had gained the door of the tavern whither
her husband had been conveyed she was ready
to drop with fatigue and alarm.</p>

<p class='c009' >And the reception she met with there was not
calculated to reassure her; evidently every one
regarded her with suspicion; and the landlord,
on learning who she was, coldly informed her
that he had no room for her; she would have to
find accommodation elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Didn’t they bring my husband here? and
isn’t he a lyin’ now in one o’ them bedrooms o’
yours?” she asked, trying to put on a bold,
defiant air.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_143' id='Page_143'>143</a></span>
“Yes; but what of that?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Why, I’ve come to nurse him; and of
course I’ll share his room; so you needn’t tell
me you haven’t got one for me.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Not so fast, woman,” returned Mr. Strong.
“The old man says you have more love for
O’Rourke than for him—in fact, he accuses you
of betraying him into the hands of his would-be
assassins, and swears that he will henceforward
have nothing whatever to do with you—neither
let you nurse him nor pay any bills of your
contracting. So, as I don’t board folks for
nothing, there’s no place for you here.”</p>

<p class='c009' >She was opening her lips to offer her services
as cook or chambermaid, when a thought of the
danger of arrest on suspicion of having been accessory
to the attempt on her husband’s life
caused a sudden abandonment of that idea.</p>

<p class='c009' >“It’s a lie!” she cried, with a show of great
indignation, “a wicked lie that I had anything
to do with them robbers tryin’ to git a holt o’
his money and kill him. If it hadn’t been fer
me a runnin’ with all my might fer help, he’d
been a dead man hours ago, a bleedin’ there on
the raft, without a soul to do nothin’ fer him.
But I’ll go and leave the ongrateful old idyot
to git along the best he kin without me.”</p>

<p class='c009' >She stooped, and taking a small parcel from
the basket which she had set down on the floor
beside her, “These is my clo’es; t’others is
hisn,” she said, and without so much as a parting
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_144' id='Page_144'>144</a></span>
salutation stalked into the street and away
faster than she had come, anger and the fear of
pursuit lending her strength.</p>

<p class='c009' >She returned to the raft, but by a roundabout
way, with the design of throwing any possible
pursuer off the scent. She reached it well-nigh
spent with exertion and the agitation of mind
she had undergone for so many hours; indeed,
for many days and weeks she had been ill at
ease, torn by conflicting emotions—hatred of the
man who tyrannized over her, reproached by
conscience for that and the guilty love indulged
for O’Rourke, tempted to abet him in his intended
crime, yet at times filled with horror at
thought of the awful deed, and terror of the more
than possible consequences to him and herself.</p>

<p class='c009' >Standing on the grassy bank below which the
raft was moored, she sent a hasty, searching
glance around. There was neither sight nor
sound of pursuit, and leaping on board, she
threw herself down on its floor and lay there
for some minutes, panting and trembling.</p>

<p class='c009' >What should she do? where fly for refuge?
there was no safety here; people would presently
be flocking to look upon the scene of the
attempted murder; she thought, as she lifted
her head and glanced about, that she perceived
evidences that some had already been there;
doubtless news of Phelim’s arrest had called
them in another direction, but surely they
would soon return, bringing others with them.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_145' id='Page_145'>145</a></span>
Some, if not all, believing the old man’s
story, would hoot and jeer at her, perhaps
offer her personal violence—throw her into the
river, drag her ashore, and, maybe, hang her
to the nearest tree; she had heard of such
things, had read in the newspapers of suspected
criminals being lynched by furious mobs, who
utterly refused to listen to their protestations of
innocence.</p>

<p class='c009' >It behooved her to fly instantly; but, ah!
whither could she go? She had neither relative
nor friend. Phelim’s parents detested her
on account of her marriage to Himes; his associates
would be very likely to make away with
her, should the chance offer, lest she should become
a witness against them. She had not been
long in the neighborhood when hired by Himes,
and had always lived a lonely life on the farm.</p>

<p class='c009' >Despair was taking possession of her when
there came to her recollection the fact that
Phelim had told her of a little cave in the rocky
bank of the river only a short distance higher
up the stream than she now was.</p>

<p class='c009' >He believed its existence to be known only to
himself, and had given her a very particular
description of its location, remarking that she
might have occasion to conceal herself there in
case suspicion should arise of her complicity in
his crime, or her presence be required as a witness
against him in court, should he be caught
and brought to trial.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_146' id='Page_146'>146</a></span>
She had a horror of caves—their dampness
and darkness, and the possibility of reptiles and
wild beasts harboring there—but such a hiding-place
seemed her last hope in this hour of fear
and peril. She remembered its existence with
a thrill of something akin to joy, and wondering
that she could have forgotten it for even a moment,
rose, gathered together a few necessaries—some
food, candles, a box of matches, a few
articles of clothing, and a blanket to lie upon—and
set out at once in search of the spot.</p>

<p class='c009' >So well had Phelim described it that she
found it with but little difficulty, though the
entrance was concealed from view by a thick
growth of bushes and creeping vines. It could
be reached only by a very steep climb up the
almost perpendicular face of the high, rocky
bank.</p>

<p class='c009' >Her first ascent was made slowly and with
much toil and fear of falling, and when at last
she had gained the rocky ledge in front of the
opening, pushed aside the overhanging vines,
and looked within, nothing but the blackness
of darkness met her gaze, and she shrank back
with a shudder, in terror of all kinds of venomous
and savage creatures.</p>

<p class='c009' >But quickly she nerved herself to enter, struck
a match, lighted a candle, and sent a searching
glance around from side to side and up overhead.
It was a small, irregularly shaped room,
the ceiling barely high enough to enable her to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_147' id='Page_147'>147</a></span>
stand upright in it, the walls of solid rock showing
no crevice wherein beast or even snake
could hide.</p>

<p class='c009' >She drew a long breath of relief, stuck her
candle in a little niche in the wall, climbed down
again to the base of the cliff, and gathering up
the articles she had brought, made the ascent a
second time, and deposited them in the cave.</p>

<p class='c009' >She was compelled to refresh herself with
rest and food before she could attempt any further
exertion; it was near sundown when she
again ventured to the vicinity of the raft, approaching
with great caution till, from the shelter
of a clump of bushes, she could obtain a view
of it.</p>

<p class='c009' >She had already heard the sound of human
voices coming from that direction, so was not
surprised, though very much disturbed, at sight
of a crowd of men and boys, with here and there
a woman or girl, upon it and the adjacent bank.</p>

<p class='c009' >They seemed to be making free with whatever
was to be found on board, and with a sigh
and a muttered, “There won’t be nothin’ left o’
our goods and things; they’ll carry ’em all off
or break ’em up; and oh, my, but won’t Himes
be mad!” She dropped down upon the grass
behind the bushes, and there waited and watched
for their departure.</p>

<p class='c009' >But the last did not leave till the glow of the
sunset had quite faded from the sky, and night’s
sable pall was slowly settling down over the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_148' id='Page_148'>148</a></span>
earth. It was already too dark to board the
raft with safety; almost too dark to make her
way back to the cavern; but moving slowly and
with extreme caution she accomplished the task.</p>

<p class='c009' >She passed a most uncomfortable night; the
blanket spread upon the rock made but a hard
bed; the air of the cave was damp, close, and
stifling; a guilty conscience, remorse, and terror
were but poor bedfellows.</p>

<p class='c009' >The hours dragged wearily along, seeming
as if they would never end; again and again
she pushed aside the overhanging vines and
peered out to see if the dawn had not come; and
with the first streak of light in the east she crept
from her hiding-place and back to the raft.</p>

<p class='c009' >She found it stripped of everything valuable.
In fact, a part of the crowd she had seen there
the previous afternoon were men sent by Mr.
Himes to remove his goods and chattels to a
place of safety.</p>

<p class='c009' >Thus she was cut off from the supplies she
had hoped to secure, and starvation would soon
be staring her in the face if she remained in hiding,
while to leave her retreat seemed too perilous
a move to be contemplated for a moment.
Yet loathing and dreading its darkness and
closeness, she lingered where she was till the
sun grew hot and she thought she descried in
the distance a man approaching from the direction
of the town. That sight sent her hurrying
back to her poor refuge in a panic of fear.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008' >The news of the arrest of O’Rourke, following
upon his robbery of Himes, more especially
because one of the notes stolen from Lakeside
was found upon his person, was highly
exasperating to Colonel Bangs. He visited the
jail that same evening, and held a rather stormy
interview with the prisoner, reminding him of
his warning that it was a dangerous thing to
carry that note about with him, and telling him
passionately that he should have kept it carefully
hidden in some safe place.</p>

<p class='c009' >“You’ve been a precious fool!” he concluded,
“for who now will put any faith in the <i>alibi</i>
I swore to in your favor?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“If ye’re the smart lawyer I take ye fer, ye
kin git me out o’ this throuble in spite o’ that,”
returned Phelim, coolly; “an’ ye’d betther be
afther thryin’ yer purtiest, or mabbe I moight
be indooced to turn State’s ividence agin ye in
that matther o’ the Lakeside burglary, to say
nothin’ o’ wan or two ither jobs o’ the same
sort.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Bangs’s face flushed hotly; he was furious at
the implied threat, but felt it his wisest course
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_150' id='Page_150'>150</a></span>
to conceal his anger and adopt a milder and
more conciliatory tone.</p>

<p class='c009' >“That would be very foolish, Phelim,” he
said, with a forced laugh; “for if you got me
sent to prison, who would defend you in future
scrapes? I’ll undertake your defence this time,
as a matter of course, and never fear that I’ll
fail to clear you. I’d be willing to wager my
head that we’ll come off with flying colors.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“But I’ll have to clear out o’ this part o’ the
counthry; ’twouldn’t niver do to attimpt to ply
me thrade round here no more.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“It would be a great risk, certainly,” returned
Bangs. “But tell me, is there any truth
in Himes’s story that his wife aided and abetted
you?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Av coorse not!” asserted Phelim; “what
fer wad she be afther poverizin’ hersilf? If the
ould man’s money was all gone, sure he’d have
none to use in buyin’ victuals an’ clo’es fer hissilf,
let alone her.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“And you weren’t intending to rob him of
her as well as the money, eh?” queried Bangs,
with a covert sneer.</p>

<p class='c009' >Phelim’s only answer was a harsh laugh.</p>

<p class='c009' >Bangs did not press the question. “I must
go now,” he said, rising and drawing out his
watch. “Good-night; I’ll be in again before
long.”</p>

<p class='c009' >The next morning, while Belinda sat in despairing
wretchedness upon the raft, and Phelim,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_151' id='Page_151'>151</a></span>
the hardened criminal, slept unconcernedly in
his prison cell, Bangs wended his way to the
butcher’s shop to secure for his dinner the cut
of beef most to his liking. He was early, but
found several customers there before him,
among them Barney Nolan.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Out of my way, fellow!” growled Bangs,
pushing rudely past Barney. “There, Hicks,”
to the butcher, who was busily at work, saw in
hand, over the dead animal, “that’s the very
cut I’m after.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Now, that’s rather a pity, isn’t it, colonel,
seein’ it’s sold already?” returned Hicks, in a
slightly sarcastic tone, taking it up with despatch,
throwing it into the scales, then wrapping
a piece of brown paper about it and bestowing
it in Barney’s basket.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Sir, I am not accustomed to such treatment!”
cried Bangs, wrathfully. “I spoke for
that particular cut before you had it sawed off.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Just so,” returned Hicks, with nonchalance;
“but Nolan spoke for it full five minutes
sooner; and it’s first come first served in this
shop.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“An Irish laborer, with a family to support,
has no business to be buying the most expensive
piece of beef in the market, when there’s
plenty of cheaper to be had,” said Bangs, eyeing
Barney with anger and disdain.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Faix, sor, an’ isn’t it jist yersilf that wad
betther be afther moindin’ yer own business,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_152' id='Page_152'>152</a></span>
an’ lavin’ an honest man, that pays as good
money an’ honest fer his mate as anny in yer
purse, to moind hisn?” queried Barney, with
air and tone of sturdy independence. “An’
I’m not a sodger no longer, sor; nor is yersilf
the colonel o’ me rigiment, to have it in yer
power to thrate me loike a brute baste intirely,
as yez did in the war that’s over an’ done wid,
thank the blissid Vargin an’ all the howly
saints.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Bangs replied with a volley of oaths and
curses, while Barney stepped leisurely past
him to the outer door and into the street, as if
he heeded them no more than the idle whistling
of the wind.</p>

<p class='c009' >Bangs shook his fist after the retreating form,
then turned and poured out the vials of his wrath
upon Hicks. He had never in all his life been
so shamefully treated! The idea of a man of
his circumstances and standing in society having
his wishes set aside for the gratification of
those of a low-born foreigner; a fellow without
means or brains!</p>

<p class='c009' >“I’ll not stand it, sir,” he concluded. “I’ll
take my custom elsewhere.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“All right, Mr. Bangs; I’m able to do without
it,” returned Hicks, with cheerful indifference;
“there’s always a plenty of folks wantin’
meat for themselves and their families.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Of course, people must eat to live,” remarked
a bystander. “And hard words are
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_153' id='Page_153'>153</a></span>
not the sort to win favors with,” he added, with
a meaning glance at Bangs—a glance that spoke
ill-concealed contempt and aversion; for the
latter—never a favorite with his neighbors and
townsmen—was growing more and more unpopular
day by day; at least, with the better
class.</p>

<p class='c009' >“I ask no favors from any man, but neither
will I submit to injustice,” he retorted, stalking
haughtily into the street and away.</p>

<p class='c009' >Meanwhile, Barney was hastening homeward,
chuckling over Bangs’s discomfiture, which on
his arrival he described with great glee to Nora
and the children.</p>

<p class='c009' >Nora had cleaning to do at Lakeside that day,
and an hour or two later rehearsed the story in
the ears of Mrs. Heath and Miriam.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Mr. Hicks was quite right,” was the old
lady’s comment, and Miriam echoed it in her
heart, though she said nothing.</p>

<p class='c009' >“And did yees know, Miss Miriam, that
Phalim O’Rourke was the scoundrel that robbed
yees, afther all, jist as Barney said? wan o’ thim
notes bein’ found on his person when they
catched him.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes, I heard it; and the note was brought
to me last night.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Indade, miss! an’ sure I’m glad fer yees
that ye’ve got it back; an’ it’s mesilf as hopes
they’ll all come back till ye—ivery wan o’ thim;
an’ it’s me that’s glad intirely they’ve got that
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_154' id='Page_154'>154</a></span>
thafe of a villain an’ murderer safe in jail. It’s
no thanks to him, the scoundrel, that the ould
man—Farmer Himes—wasn’t kilt intirely; an’
for why shouldn’t he swing for the wicked
deed?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“The law doesn’t hang men in this State,”
said Miriam; “besides, fortunately, Mr. Himes
isn’t dead, and the doctors, I believe, consider
him likely to recover.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“An’ sure, miss, wad the loike o’ that be
afther makin’ anny difference to the dirty rascal,
Phalim O’Rourke?” asked Nora; “wad they
be afther lettin’ him go?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“He’ll be tried for his crime, and if found
guilty will be sent to the penitentiary for a
term of years,” answered Miriam.</p>

<p class='c009' >“An’ Misther Bangs wull be afther clearin’
av him, av coorse,” remarked Nora, in extreme
disgust.</p>

<p class='c009' >“I think it altogether likely he will try to do
so,” Miriam said.</p>

<p class='c009' >Before the day was over she had learned that
her surmise was correct, and the tidings increased
her already intense detestation of Bangs.
She could see no redeeming trait in his character,
and strongly suspected him of being in
league with the band of burglars who had
committed so many depredations in the valley
for months past. Surely that <i>alibi</i> he had
sworn to on Phelim’s trial for the Lakeside
burglary was a lie, and what motive could he
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_155' id='Page_155'>155</a></span>
have had for thus perjuring himself unless he
were a party to the theft and a sharer in the
spoils?</p>

<p class='c009' >She put that query to Ronald while having a
little private chat with him before they separated
for the night.</p>

<p class='c009' >“It certainly looks very suspicious,” he said
in reply; “still it is possible that some one else
may have committed the robbery here—another
one of the gang, for instance—and passed off
the note upon O’Rourke afterward, and that
Bangs had had no connection with the deed or
knowledge of it afterward.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes,” returned Miriam, slowly and thoughtfully,
“I suppose it is possible, yet I cannot help
feeling that my suspicion is just; I am morally
certain of it; and I shall find it difficult to treat
Bangs with the barest civility should he ever
call here again.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“He will be here again; I haven’t a doubt of
it,” Ronald said, laughingly. “It’s plain that
he comes a wooing, Mirry; but I warn you that
I shall never give my consent to the match.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“It will never be asked by me,” she said,
her eyes flashing and the hot blood surging
over face and neck at the thought of the baseness
of the man and the audacity of his pursuit
of her. “Oh, Ronald, I would die a thousand
deaths rather than link my life with that of so
sordid, cruel, haughty, and unprincipled a
wretch!”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_156' id='Page_156'>156</a></span>
“And I,” said Ronald, dropping his bantering
tone and speaking with emotion, “should
even prefer to see my darling Sister Miriam
sleeping peacefully in her coffin; though what
we should ever do without her I cannot tell.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I think you are not likely to find out very
soon, Ron dear,” she said, forcing a smile, for
her heart was very heavy; “I’m strong and
healthy, and hope to live till you are all ready
to do without me.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“In that case you certainly will not die
young, sister mine,” he responded, with a look
of strong, brotherly affection. “But you are
worn out with the cares and labors of the day;
so we’ll say good-night; and don’t, I beg of
you, sit up to sew, or lie awake brooding over
losses and the perplexing problem how we are
to pay off that troublesome mortgage. It’s a
good omen that a part of the stolen money has
been recovered, and I do believe we’ll be helped
through the whole difficulty. Just think what
good Christians our father and mother were,
and how many prayers they sent up for us,
their loved children.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes; it is often the greatest comfort to me
to think of that, and of what the Bible says
about a good man leaving an inheritance to his
children’s children,” she said, smiling through
tears.</p>

<p class='c009' >The next few weeks were a time of heavy
trial to Miriam. Bangs beset her at every turn,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_157' id='Page_157'>157</a></span>
meeting her in her walks and rides, coming on
her when she was in the field, and could not
escape from him, and urging his suit with persuasions,
promises, and threats, determined to
win her, in spite of the most firm and decided
rejection repeated again and again.</p>

<p class='c009' >And Warren Charlton, whose visits were
always so welcome, stayed away. She would
hardly own it to herself, but that was an added
drop in her cup of bitterness, as she wondered
vaguely what she could have said or done to
offend him.</p>

<p class='c009' >She did her best to hide her troubles from
her grandmother and Ronald, assuming in their
presence a cheerfulness and even gayety which
she was far from feeling. The only friends in
whom she felt ready to confide, and whose
sympathy and advice would have been a help
to her, were Dr. and Mrs. Jasper; but she had
not the heart to ask it of them, a pathetic note
from Serena having acquainted her with the
trial they were passing through.</p>

<p class='c009' >Earthly helpers failed her; she seemed left
to breast the storm alone, while the clouds grew
darker day by day, as Bangs waxed more and
more wroth at her steadfast refusal to bend to
his will.</p>

<p class='c009' >Then she turned for help to the God of her
fathers, crying to Him: “‘Deliver me, oh, my
God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the
hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.’”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_158' id='Page_158'>158</a></span>
Meanwhile, Mr. Himes was recovering from
his wounds much more rapidly than had been
supposed possible, and was gloating over the
prospect of bringing his intended murderer to
trial. He held frequent interviews with Charlton,
and the latter was kept very busy in hunting
up evidence in that and several important
cases likely to be called up at the next term of
court.</p>

<p class='c009' >It was this unusual pressure of important business
which kept him away from Lakeside, in
spite of a strong desire to see his friends there—Miriam
not less than other members of the
family.</p>

<p class='c009' >Mr. Himes’s condition had so greatly improved
that he was no longer confined to his
room, but usually spent the greater part of the
day among the loungers on the porch before
the barroom door, and occasionally walked a
short distance up or down the street. He was
an early riser, and often came down-stairs long
before the call to breakfast, eager to exchange
the closeness and heat of his circumscribed
bedroom for the fresh outside air of street or
porch.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Strong,” he asked, one evening as they sat
smoking there together, “what’s become o’
that raft o’ mine? d’ye know?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I b’lieve it’s lyin’ moored just where ye left
it,” was the reply; “I heard somebody say so
a day or two since.”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_159' id='Page_159'>159</a></span>
“Well, I’m goin’ to walk out there and see
for myself.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I wouldn’t try a walk o’ that length yet
awhile, if I was you, Himes,” returned Strong,
with a look of surprise; “ye’re weak yet and
the weather’s hot; the sun was scorching hot
to-day.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Then I’ll be up and off before sunrise; back
again before your breakfast-bell rings. I’ll try
it to-morrow mornin’.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I wouldn’t if I was you,” repeated Strong;
“you haven’t got the strength for it; besides,”
drawing closer to the old man and speaking in
an undertone, “there’s been two suspicious-looking
fellows hanging round the town for the
last day or two, and who knows but they may
belong to the gang that robbed and tried to
murder you? They may be watching an opportunity
to finish up the job.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Nonsense! I won’t have a cent about me,
and, of course, it was the money they was after
then. Besides, the rascal that did the job is
fast locked up in jail now.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes; but they may be wantin’ to put you
out o’ the way, so’s you can’t give evidence
against him on the trial. I wouldn’t trust ’em.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I’m not afeard,” sneered the old man; “I
never gave nobody no reason to call me a coward,
and I don’t mean to, neither.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Common-sense prudence is not cowardice,”
returned the landlord; “in your weak state
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_160' id='Page_160'>160</a></span>
you’d stand no chance against one strong man,
let alone two.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“It’s all guesswork that those fellers belong
to the gang and are after me, and I don’t believe
a word of it,” said Himes, testily.</p>

<p class='c009' >Strong was beginning a fresh expostulation
when his wife interposed, “Oh, let him alone,
John, do! If he’s a mind to throw away his life,
why need you worry yourself to prevent him?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Well, now, that’s not it,” said Himes; “I’ve
no mind to throw away my life; not till I’ve
seen Phelim O’Rourke brought to justice, anyhow;
so I’ll maybe put off goin’ out o’ town
for a while; I’m gittin’ stronger every day.”
With that he knocked the ashes from his pipe,
put it in his pocket, and with a gruff, “Good-night
to ye, folks,” started off for his bedroom.</p>

<p class='c009' >The old man had a good deal of obstinacy and
tenacity of purpose in his composition, and
waking early the next morning, he resolved to
carry out his plan at once; for why should
he care what Strong and his wife thought about
it? he had as much sense as either of them, or
both together, for that matter.</p>

<p class='c009' >He hurried on his clothes and stole quietly
from the house, for it was hardly broad daylight,
and no one, not even a servant, yet astir.</p>

<p class='c009' >An hour later a farmer driving into the town
with a load of produce for the market found
him lying dead by the roadside, foully murdered;
the assassins had done their work
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_161' id='Page_161'>161</a></span>
thoroughly this time, and life was utterly
extinct.</p>

<p class='c009' >The news flew like lightning, not through
Fairfield only, but to the neighboring towns
and all up and down the valley, being telegraphed
from point to point.</p>

<p class='c009' >It caused great excitement, and increased the
feeling of hot indignation against the leader of
the gang, by whose orders, as almost every one
believed, this second and successful attempt
had been made upon the old man’s life; and
also the unpopularity of Bangs, who was to
defend him on the approaching trial.</p>

<p class='c009' >Besides that, it set men to discussing the
justice and righteousness of the law of the State,
which ran counter to that law of God, “Whoso
sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood
be shed.”</p>

<p class='c009' >The large majority felt and said that the
death penalty was the only adequate punishment
that could be inflicted upon O’Rourke and
his confederates, who had finally accomplished
the deed of blood attempted by him, and them
under his leadership.</p>

<p class='c009' >Miriam heard the news with a thrill of horror.
“Had Bangs had anything to do with the
instigation of the atrocious crime?” she asked
herself; “might he not be wicked enough to
connive at such a deed, that thus the principal
witness against his client should be prevented
from testifying at the trial?”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_162' id='Page_162'>162</a></span>
She shuddered at the thought, but could not
banish it, and when, a few days later, he called
to once more press his suit, she shrank from
him in undisguised aversion.</p>

<p class='c009' >It roused him to fury, which he vainly endeavored
to hide under an appearance of lover-like
devotion. He had come to her in no
amiable mood, for ever since the news of
Himes’s death had reached Prairieville his fellow-townsmen
had treated him to nothing but
looks of coldness, scorn, and contempt. No
one meeting him on the street or in the haunts
of business had a word of cordial greeting for
him; each passed him by with scarcely a nod
of recognition, and their glances spoke only
disapproval and suspicion. It maddened him;
all the more because his conscience was not
clear; and he had been on the verge of a
violent quarrel several times during the day.</p>

<p class='c009' >It was about the middle of the afternoon
when he reached Lakeside, and found Miriam
alone in the shaded porch, resting and reading
after many hours of close attention to affairs
indoors and out.</p>

<p class='c009' >Ignoring the coldness of her greeting, he
took a seat close at her side, and pouring out a
perfect torrent of protestations of admiration
and love, repeated the offer of his hand and
heart.</p>

<p class='c009' >Lifting her head proudly, and looking him full
in the eye, “Colonel Bangs,” she said, “how
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_163' id='Page_163'>163</a></span>
often must I repeat my refusal before you will
receive it as final?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Forever!” he cried, his eyes flashing with
anger. “I tell you, girl, I will never give you
up; marry me you shall! I have you in my
power, and you cannot escape me. I should
much prefer to have you a willing bride, but—I’ll
even take you against your will rather
than not have you at all.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Miriam rose from her chair and stepped back
a pace or two; then confronting him with pale
but dauntless face, “What right have you to
address such language to me, sir?” she asked,
in freezing, haughty tones, holding her head
proudly erect and gazing unflinchingly into his
eyes. “I am a free woman, living in a free
land, and no one can compel me to marry
against my inclination.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Even a free woman may find the compelling
force of circumstances too strong for her,”
he retorted; “and I think it will be so in your
case, for only by consenting to become my
wife can you save yourself and those nearest
and dearest to you from being turned out homeless
into the world.”</p>

<p class='c009' >She had grown very pale while he spoke, but
she answered in firm, though gentle tones, and
with the same dauntless air with which she had
replied to him at first, “To do as you wish
would be a sin, because to love, honor, or respect
you would be impossible to me. I utterly
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_164' id='Page_164'>164</a></span>
refuse compliance, and putting my trust in God,
my father’s God, I defy you to do your worst!”</p>

<p class='c009' >“And I’ll do it. I’ll take steps for the foreclosing
of that mortgage before I’m a day
older,” he said, in low tones of concentrated
fury, as he rose and bowed himself out.</p>

<p class='c009' >Turning on the threshold, “How happy you
will feel when you have to leave this beautiful
place, the comfortable home and the farm that
has been your means of support! How you
will enjoy the distress of your aged grandmother
and the little orphan brother and sister, knowing
you could have spared them all their pain
and suffering!”</p>

<p class='c009' >An expression of anguish swept over her features,
but was gone in a moment, while in a firm
voice she answered, “I trust in Him of whom
the Bible tells me, ‘He shall judge the poor of
the people, He shall save the children of the
needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.... He
shall deliver the needy when he
crieth; the poor, also, and him that hath no
helper.’”</p>

<p class='c009' >He had heard enough, and hurried away with
the words ringing in his ears, while Miriam
sought the privacy of her own room, to pour
out her distresses and her cry for deliverance
from the unrighteous and cruel man to Him
who had declared Himself the “Father of the
fatherless and a judge of the widows” and “the
hearer and answerer of prayer.”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_165' id='Page_165'>165</a></span>
Bangs had walked out from the town, and was
now hurrying back to it, almost beside himself
with rage, mortification, and disappointment.
He had made sure that Miriam would yield to
his demand rather than face the alternative he
set before her; and the estimate of his character
which she had given him was far from flattering
to his self-love and conceit.</p>

<p class='c009' >There had been nothing of unselfish love in
his passion for her, and now it was turned to
bitterest hate, so that he could have found a
fiendish delight in dealing her a death-blow; in
fact, he was so full of rage and hatred toward
the whole human race, that he would have felt
an inclination to attack almost any one who
should cross his path.</p>

<p class='c009' >He met no one, however, till he had reached
the principal business street of the town; then,
as he hurried along, catching the sound of footsteps
in his rear, he turned about to find Barney
Nolan coming toward him at a pace nearly as
rapid as his own.</p>

<p class='c009' >“What are you following me for, scoundrel?”
he demanded, accompanying the query with a
volley of oaths and curses.</p>

<p class='c009' >“It’s mesilf as has as good a right to walk
the strates o’ the town as you, sor,” retorted
Barney. “Go ’long wid yees, an’ niver be
afther thryin’ to kape Barney Nolan in order.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“None of your impudence, sirrah!” growled
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_166' id='Page_166'>166</a></span>
Bangs, walking on, Barney still keeping in his
wake.</p>

<p class='c009' >In another minute he faced about upon the
Irishman again, crying furiously, “I’ll not be
followed by you or anybody else, and I tell
you if you don’t stop it instantly it’ll be the
worse for you!”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I’m not followin’ ye, but jist goin’ about
me own business, an’ that same I’ll continue to
do,” returned Barney, coolly.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Do it at your peril!” cried Bangs, grinding
his teeth with rage.</p>

<p class='c009' >He walked on again a few paces, but still
hearing the echoing footsteps in his rear, pulled
out a pistol, and turning toward Barney for the
third time, fired, instantly killing the innocent
object of his unreasonable anger.</p>

<p class='c009' >Before the report had fairly died away people
came rushing to the spot from all directions, so
that in less than five minutes a mob of infuriated
men had collected, and Bangs perceived at once
that he would be lynched unless he could save
himself by flight.</p>

<p class='c009' >He darted down a side street and flew onward,
the mob in hot pursuit. Panting, breathless,
he gained a large distillery, and rushing
in, hid behind the casks of beer.</p>

<p class='c009' >But the mob were close at his heels; they instantly
swarmed over the whole building, hunting
for him with yells and shouts of rage.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Where is he—the bloody assassin?” “Catch
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_167' id='Page_167'>167</a></span>
him!” “Hang him!” “Lynch him!” “Don’t
wait for the law; that’ll only send the wretch to
State prison, though he’s killed a better man
than himself!”</p>

<p class='c009' >Bangs crouched in his hiding-place, shaking
with terror. Presently the barrels in front of
him were violently shoved aside, a dozen hands
seized him with no gentle grasp, and he was
dragged out with exultant shouts of fury.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Here he is! we’ve got the double-dyed villain,
the bloody-handed murderer, and we’ll
deal out even-handed justice to him!”</p>

<p class='c009' >“That we will!” echoed a chorus of voices.</p>

<p class='c009' >“A rope! a rope!” was the next cry; “a
rope round the murderer’s neck, and off with
him to the big oak-tree in front of Barton’s.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Hicks, the butcher, came pushing his way
through the crowd with a stout rope in his
hands.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Here, boys, how’ll this answer? It’s what
I brought that bull into town with yesterday,
and I reckon it’s strong enough to hold this
wild beast. Hold him, and I’ll put it round his
neck!”</p>

<p class='c009' >Bangs’s face was ashen, and he was trembling
like an aspen leaf.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Friends, neighbors,” he began, hoarsely,
“will you murder me? Will you send me into
eternity without a moment’s time to prepare?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“How many minutes did you give Barney
Nolan?” asked a stern voice. “‘With what
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_168' id='Page_168'>168</a></span>
measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you
again.’”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes, yes! Off with him! Off with him!
That’s right,” as Hicks threw the rope over the
head of the trembling culprit, and drew it close
about his neck.</p>

<p class='c009' >A shriek of mortal anguish went up from the
pale lips quivering with fright: “The law!
Let the law deal with me, and don’t stain your
hands with my blood!”</p>

<p class='c009' >“No, no! the law’s too easy for a wretch like
you!” they yelled in his ears, as they dragged
him away out of the building, over the sidewalk
to the middle of the street, and on, on, his head
striking against the cobble-stones at every step.</p>

<p class='c009' >He was dead before they reached the tree
where they meant to hang him, but they raised
the lifeless body to one of its branches, and left
it dangling there, all the same.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008' >The pistol-shot echoed and re-echoed from
the hills, the roar of the mob, the shouts
and yells of rage were heard at Lakeside, creating
wonder and consternation there.</p>

<p class='c009' >Miriam had scarcely risen from her knees,
and her heart was still going up in earnest
pleadings for help from on high, when the report
of the pistol struck her ear.</p>

<p class='c009' >“What was that?” she asked herself. “Some
one shooting at a mark, perhaps; it is not the
time of year for hunting game.”</p>

<p class='c009' >She remained a few moments longer in her
room, then, at the call to tea, descended the
stairs to the lower hall. Just as she reached it
the more startling and alarming sounds made
by the mob began to be heard.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Oh, what is it? what is happening in Prairieville?”
she exclaimed, rushing into the dining-room,
where the other members of the family
were already gathered.</p>

<p class='c009' >Her grandmother stood listening with pale,
excited face, little Olive clinging to her skirts
with affrighted looks, while Ronald and McAllister
exchanged glances of surprise and inquiry,
and Bertie tried to conceal his alarm by assuming
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_170' id='Page_170'>170</a></span>
an air of manly unconcern, though his
young heart beat fast and the color had left his
cheek.</p>

<p class='c009' >McAllister was the first to reply to Miriam’s
question.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Dinna be fashed, Miss Mirry,” he said;
“I ken the soun’ weel, for I hae heard it afore;
it’s the roaring and raging o’ a mob o’ infuriated
men. Belike thae hae caught ane or more o’
the burglars, and are takin’ justice into their
ain hands. The soun’s we hear bode ill to some
ane; but it canna be you or yours.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“That shot, then, you think was intended for
a man?” said Ronald.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Na doot, sir! It may be that Phelim
O’Rourke has broken jail. I ken he’d be vary
likely to be shot doon by some o’ them he’s
robbed and tried to murder, sooner than he’d
’scape to do mair o’ the same kin’ o’ mischief.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Phelim O’Rourke was at that moment in his
cell, listening as intently as they to the ominous
sounds—listening with paling cheek and dilated
eyes, while standing at the grated window,
vainly striving to get a view of what was going
on far down the street.</p>

<p class='c009' >He, too, recognized the hoarse cries of men
with passions roused to a frenzy of rage and
hate. Were they coming to lynch him? No;
that shot fired a moment ago must have been
intended for another than himself; some one of
his confederates, in all probability.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_171' id='Page_171'>171</a></span>
But when they had finished dealing with the
lesser member of the band, what more natural
than that they should turn their rage upon its
leader?</p>

<p class='c009' >The thought brought out the cold beads of
perspiration upon his brow, and he caught at the
iron bars with a desperate effort to wrench
them from their place and escape.</p>

<p class='c009' >In vain; the task was beyond his strength;
and with a groan of despair he relinquished the
attempt.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Well, it’s mesilf, Phalim O’Rourke, that’ll
die game, annyhow, if it has to come till that
same,” he muttered, grinding his teeth together,
and pacing his narrow cell to and fro, like a
wild beast in his cage.</p>

<p class='c009' >Then he called aloud to the jailor, asking
what all the noise was about; but no one came
to answer his inquiry.</p>

<p class='c009' >“I wish,” said Ronald Heath,“that I were
able to run down there and see what it is all
about.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I’m glad to have you kept out of it,” said
his grandmother; “it seems to be always the
innocent lookers-on that get hurt in time of a
riot.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“The impulse to seek the scene o’ excitement
is vary natural to most folk, I think,” remarked
McAllister—“to those o’ the male sex at least;
but unless ane is likely to be o’ use in aiding the
right, it’s far wiser to stay away.”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_172' id='Page_172'>172</a></span>
As by common consent they had all left the
dining-room for the porch, and there they remained—too
much excited to think of eating—listening
intently to the yells and cries till the
last of them had died away. Then they went
through the form of taking their meal, but with
scant appetite for the food, though it was well
prepared and savory.</p>

<p class='c009' >McAllister was just saying, as they rose from
the table, “I’ll gang doun to the toun now an’
find out what’s been goin’ on there,” when a
horseman dashed up to the gate and dismounted.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Warren!” exclaimed Ronald, catching
sight of his friend through the open window;
“he’s brought us the news.”</p>

<p class='c009' >He hurried out as he spoke, all the others
following, in the general anxiety to learn
the cause of the unusual commotion in the
town.</p>

<p class='c009' >Charlton fastened his horse, opened the gate,
and hastened up the path, meeting Ronald about
half-way to the house.</p>

<p class='c009' >The latter spoke first. “What news, Warren?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Dreadful! most dreadful!” he cried, passing
his hand over his brow, like one half-stunned
by some sudden calamity.</p>

<p class='c009' >“So we feared from the strange and ominous
sounds that have reached us. Come into the
porch and take a seat, while you tell us all about
it,” said Ronald, leading the way.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_173' id='Page_173'>173</a></span>
Charlton followed, shook hands in silence
with Mrs. Heath and Miriam, then sat down,
the family grouping themselves about him.</p>

<p class='c009' >He was very pale and seemed much agitated.
“Yes,” he sighed, “an awful thing has happened
in Prairieville, our own town; two souls
have been hurried into eternity without a moment
of time for preparation.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Murder?” asked Ronald, in a low, awe-struck
tone.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Murder and lynching. Bangs shot Barney
Nolan down dead in the street without the
slightest excuse for it, except that he was in a
towering passion about something—nobody
knows what—and—”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Was lynched for it?” queried McAllister,
as the captain paused in his story.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes; he did not live many minutes after
the mob got hold of him.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Hardly conscious why he did so, Charlton
glanced at Miriam with the last words; their
eyes met, and he saw a look of keenest anguish
come into hers, a deathly pallor suddenly overspread
her features.</p>

<p class='c009' >The pang that sight caused him was sharp as
a dagger’s thrust. “Could it be possible that
she cared for Bangs? a man so utterly devoid
of principle or honor, so hot-tempered, wicked,
and cruel? that she could have cherished a feeling
of love for one so base, so utterly unworthy
of her?” The idea seemed preposterous; yet
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_174' id='Page_174'>174</a></span>
what else could explain her strong emotion on
hearing of his death?</p>

<p class='c009' >The others, occupied with what he was saying,
did not notice Miriam’s emotion.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Lynched! what does that mean?” asked
Bertie, in wide-eyed wonder.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Never mind, dear,” said his grandmother,
rising in some haste and leading him and Olive
away; “children can’t understand these things.
It’s all over now, and we’ll think and talk of
something else.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes; Mrs. Heath is right,” Charlton observed,
in a low voice; “and the details are
sickening; hardly fit for any but men’s ears.”</p>

<p class='c009' >At that Miriam also rose and went quietly
away to seek again the privacy of her own
room. Closing the door, she threw herself face
down upon the bed, pressing both hands upon
her temples. Her brain was in a whirl of contending
emotions, in which, for the moment, a
feeling as if she were partly responsible for
Bangs’s awful end was uppermost.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Oh, did I call down vengeance upon his
head?” she moaned, half aloud; “would he
have been slain if I had not cried to God for
deliverance from him? O God, Thou knowest
I did not desire his death; and Thou hast
said, ‘Call upon Me in the day of trouble; I
will deliver thee.’ I thank Thee for the deliverance,
but oh, in what a fearful manner it has
been wrought!”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_175' id='Page_175'>175</a></span>
Charlton was going on with his story to Ronald
and McAllister. His office was in a room
in the second story of a building directly opposite
the brewery in which Bangs had sought a
hiding-place. He was writing there, he said,
when Bangs fired the shot that killed Barney,
and starting up at the sound, went to the window,
from which he saw all that followed without
becoming a participator in the doings of the
mob.</p>

<p class='c009' >“It was horrible!” exclaimed Ronald, upon
the conclusion of the narrative, “yet one can’t
help feeling that he deserved his fate for his unprovoked
murder of a man like Barney—a decent,
respectable man, and with a family to support;
a good-natured, harmless fellow, so far
as I can judge from what I have seen of him.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes, sir; Barney Nolan was a’ that,” said
McAllister; “he’s been employed aboot the
farm here lang enough for me to mak’ sure o’
that.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Charlton lingered some time longer, hoping
for another glimpse of Miriam, but she did not
rejoin them, and finally he said good-evening
and went away.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Where is Miriam?” asked Mrs. Heath,
joining Ronald on the porch.</p>

<p class='c009' >“I don’t know, grandma,” he answered, in
some surprise; “I thought she was with you.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“No; I left her here. Perhaps she has gone
to see Nora. Oh, what an awful thing for that
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_176' id='Page_176'>176</a></span>
poor woman to have her husband shot down in
that sudden, cruel way!”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes; one cannot wonder at the exasperation
of the public; and considering the impossibility
of meting out to the murderer his deserved
punishment, through the agency of the law,
I can hardly blame them for lynching him; but
dragging him through the streets, bumping his
head on the cobble-stones, was, to say the least,
unnecessary cruelty.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Did they do that, Ronald? Oh, how horrible!”</p>

<p class='c009' >At that moment Miriam joined them, taking
a chair between her grandmother and brother.
Her face was very pale, and she had evidently
been weeping a good deal.</p>

<p class='c009' >Ronald noted it with surprise and concern.
“My dear sister,” he said, kindly, “don’t distress
yourself about this dreadful occurrence.
Why should you? Bangs was no friend to
you.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“No; but—it is almost more dreadful to me
because he was—an enemy, and—Oh, you do
not know that it was I who angered him so that
he shot poor Barney down! Oh, poor, poor
Nora! What will she ever do?” she added,
with a bitter sob; “and I—I feel as if I had
killed them both.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Oh, Miriam, you are too sensible a girl to
think anything of the kind!” exclaimed Ronald.
“You did not give Bangs his dreadful temper,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_177' id='Page_177'>177</a></span>
or put Barney in his way; nor were you the
cause of the enmity between them.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Oh, you don’t know all!” cried Miriam;
“I have been keeping some things from you
and grandmother, because—because I didn’t
want to distress you; but now I’ll tell you all!”</p>

<p class='c009' >Then she went on to give a full account of
Bangs’s efforts to induce her to consent to become
his wife, including his threats, founded
on the fact that he had got the mortgage on
Lakeside into his possession, and all that had
passed between them at that day’s interview;
also the fury of passion he was in when he left
her.</p>

<p class='c009' >She told also of her cry to God for deliverance
out of the hand of the unrighteous and
cruel man, and how, because of that, she felt
almost that she had helped to bring him to his
fearful end.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Mirry, my child,” her grandmother said,
with emotion, and laying a hand affectionately
upon the young girl’s arm, “do not be distressed
with any such feeling; you have no
reason to blame yourself; you but obeyed the
command, ‘Call upon Me in the day of trouble;’
which was right, wise, and your duty, and God
took His own way to answer your prayer.</p>

<p class='c009' >“If Mr. Bangs had been a diligent Bible
student he might have known he had great
reason to fear some such fate, if he persisted in
so oppressing the widow and orphans; because
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_178' id='Page_178'>178</a></span>
in the Book of Exodus we read, ‘Ye shall not
afflict any widow or fatherless child. If thou
afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto
Me, I will surely hear their cry; and My wrath
shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the
sword.’”</p>

<p class='c009' >There was a moment of silence, then Ronald
said, “What a fearful threat! And it seems to
have been very speedily fulfilled in Bangs’s
case; though it may be that other helpless ones
have been crying to God for relief from his oppressions
for years. I have heard it asserted
that much of his wealth was obtained by fraud
and oppression of the weak and helpless; but
in any event, Mirry, I am sure you need not
feel that any blame attaches to you; it is a
morbid feeling that I trust will soon pass away.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“And you are delivered out of his hands.
You should thank God for that, Miriam; we
all should,” remarked the old lady, taking her
granddaughter’s hand and pressing it tenderly
in hers.</p>

<p class='c009' >Dr. Jasper’s arrival just at that time prevented
a reply from Miriam. He, too, was full
of the fearful events of the last few hours; had
come directly from the scene of anguish in Barney
Nolan’s home, where Nora and the children
were weeping over the dead body of the husband
and father. The good doctor’s eyes filled,
and his voice trembled with emotion as he went
on to describe the grief and despair of the new-made
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_179' id='Page_179'>179</a></span>
widow and orphans, and his listeners
wept in sympathy.</p>

<p class='c009' >“My heart bleeds for them,” said Mrs.
Heath; “yet if Bangs had left a wife, her case
would, I think, be more pitiable still, knowing
that her husband so richly deserved his fate.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I quite agree with you in that,” the doctor
said; “but I believe he has left no nearer relative
or connection than that sister of his, Mrs.
Wiley.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I should think it enough to make her insane,”
said Ronald. “How she must be feeling
now!”</p>

<p class='c009' >“She is out of town,” said the doctor, “and
I presume has not yet heard of the fearful events
of to-day.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“She inherits her brother’s property, I suppose,”
remarked Ronald, musingly, “and will,
therefore, become the holder of the mortgage
on our home.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Are you in trouble about that?” Dr. Jasper
asked, in a tone of friendly sympathy and concern.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes, sir; we fear there is danger of foreclosure,
should the holder be so inclined; for
we lack the means to pay off even the interest
that is due.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Don’t be uneasy; I trust that danger may
be readily averted,” returned the doctor, cheerily;
“doubtless the money to pay off the whole
indebtedness can be borrowed, the lender being
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_180' id='Page_180'>180</a></span>
secured by a new mortgage; and I dare say
Captain Charlton will be able to arrange the
business for you in a satisfactory manner, finding
a mortgagee who will not care to hurry you
unduly for payment.”</p>

<p class='c009' >The faces about him grew brighter at his
words.</p>

<p class='c009' >“I wonder I had not thought of that before,”
exclaimed Ronald.</p>

<p class='c009' >“You are kind, very kind, doctor,” said Mrs.
Heath. “‘A friend in need is a friend indeed.’”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Ah, my dear madam, advice is cheap,” he
said; “when not professional,” he added,
laughingly. “I shall speak to Charlton, and
we will see what can be done.” Then, as he
rose to go, “Ah, I had nearly forgotten! Miss
Miriam, Serena bade me give you this,” drawing
from his pocket a note written on tinted
paper, and directed in a delicate female hand.
“You will not find it a doleful missive,” he
went on, a joyous look coming into his eyes;
“the dark and threatening cloud that overshadowed
us has passed away, and we are again
rejoicing in the sunlight; for which I trust we
are sincerely grateful to the Giver of all good.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Ah, I am very, very glad for you both!”
Miriam exclaimed, and the others united their
congratulations with hers.</p>

<p class='c009' >“We have all felt for you and your sweet
wife, doctor,” said the dear old lady, “and are
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_181' id='Page_181'>181</a></span>
rejoiced that she is not to be torn from you.
Golding has relinquished his claim and consented
to leave you undisturbed?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes; after standing out against the measure
for a time that seemed very long to us, he finally
agreed to unite with Serena in asking for a
divorce; and under the circumstances the judge
was able to grant it without bringing the matter
into court. Then Serena and I were quietly
remarried, and Golding has gone, leaving his son
with us; for which I am most thankful, for I
think it would have killed Serena to be deprived
of either of her children.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“How happened it that you were so strangely
deceived in regard to Mr. Golding’s death?”
asked Mrs. Heath.</p>

<p class='c009' >“I believe it was a cousin of the same name
whose death was reported to Serena as that of
her husband. I presume there was no intentional
deceit; but it cannot be denied that
Golding was greatly to blame in absenting himself
so long from home, and never during all
that time attempting any communication with
his wife. Besides, even before that he had
given her Bible grounds for divorce. So that
my conscience is entirely clear in asserting my
claim to be superior to his,” he concluded, his
countenance beaming with satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c009' >“I think it well may be, and that Golding’s
conduct has been very cruel from first to last,”
remarked Mrs. Heath.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_182' id='Page_182'>182</a></span>
“Yes,” assented the doctor, with a sigh.
“Ah, well, I must try to make it up to her
during the rest of our two lives!”</p>

<p class='c009' >With that he took his departure, and Miriam
opened her note. It was written in a most
cheerful strain, asking her sympathy in the
writer’s joy over her deliverance from the great
trial of the last few weeks.</p>

<p class='c009' >“My dear,” she wrote, “if ever you are in
sore distress, cry to the Lord for deliverance,
as I did, and He will surely hear. ‘In His
favor is life; weeping may endure for a night,
but joy cometh in the morning.’”</p>

<p class='c009' >The thought comforted Miriam. “Shall it
not be so with me also, and even with poor
Nora?” she asked herself, with a feeling of
partial relief and hopefulness, as she refolded
the note and put it in her pocket.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Grandmother,” she said, aloud, “will you
go with me to see poor Nora? You will, I am
sure, know how to speak a word of comfort to
her.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes,” Mrs. Heath said, rising; “I can at
least repeat to her some of the precious Bible
promises to the widow and the fatherless; and
we will carry them something to eat. The
children will be hungry, even if grief deprives
the mother of her appetite.”</p>

<p class='c009' >The night that followed that day was to
Miriam the longest and saddest she had ever
known in all her young, healthful life. Her
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_183' id='Page_183'>183</a></span>
heart was sore for Nora in her overwhelming
grief and despair, and full of horror at the remembrance
of Bangs’s crime and the fearful
retribution that had so speedily overtaken him.</p>

<p class='c009' >She slept little till toward morning, and in
consequence rose somewhat later than her usual
hour. Hastening down-stairs to begin the
duties of the day, she met McAllister in the
lower hall.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Gude-mornin’, Miss Mirry. The captain
left this as he was ridin’ by a few moments
since, biddin’ me give it to you,” he said, handing
her a note.</p>

<p class='c009' >In spite of a determined effort to seem unconcerned,
Miriam felt her cheeks flush hotly as
she took the missive and glanced at the address,
unmistakably in Charlton’s handwriting.</p>

<p class='c009' >“You should have asked the captain to come
in and take breakfast with us, Sandy,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009' >“I urged the hospitalities o’ the hoose upon
him, Miss Mirry,” was the reply, “but he was
no to be persuaded. However, he said something
aboot givin’ you a call in the course o’
the mornin’.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Ronald joined them at that moment with a
bright “Good-morning, Mirry. Who’s that
intends to call on us to-day?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“The captain wants to see your sister, sir,”
said McAllister; but Miriam had slipped away,
hiding the note in the bosom of her dress as she
went.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_184' id='Page_184'>184</a></span>
“He does!” exclaimed Ronald, with laughing
eyes. “Well, I for one shall make him
welcome to see her—in my presence or alone.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Sandy did not mention the note, shrewdly
guessing that silence upon that matter would
be more pleasing to Miriam.</p>

<p class='c009' >She seemed slightly abstracted during breakfast,
and took an early opportunity after leaving
the table to steal away by herself to learn in
solitude what Warren had to say to her.</p>

<p class='c009' >Her heart fluttered and the rose on her cheek
deepened as she broke the seal and glanced at
the contents of his note; then with an exclamation
of astonishment she hurried to the dining-room,
where she had left her grandmother and
Ronald consulting together about some work
to be done in the garden.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Why, Mirry, what now? What has happened
that you look so excited?” asked her
brother, as she came in with the note open in
her hand.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Something so wonderful that I can hardly
believe it,” she answered, dropping into a chair,
her eyes shining, her breath coming half pantingly.
“I—I’ve had a small fortune left me!”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Can it be possible!” exclaimed Ronald.
“Where in the world does it come from?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Listen,” she said, and went on to read the
letter aloud; merely a business one it was, informing
her that the late Mr. Himes had made
a will shortly before his death, bequeathing to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_185' id='Page_185'>185</a></span>
her—Miriam Heath—all his earthly possessions,
consisting principally of the money he had received
for his farm and some United States
bonds, amounting in all to $10,000.</p>

<p class='c009' >He had told Captain Charlton that he had no
near relative or friend—no one to whom he
cared to leave anything; and having a high estimate
of Miriam’s worth, and a great admiration
for what he called her pluck and enterprise, he
had selected her for his heir in preference to
any one else.</p>

<p class='c009' >“There,” cried the excited girl, waving the
letter above her head, “it will be more than
enough to save the place and stock the farm,
too, with all the cattle we want!”</p>

<p class='c009' >“But, Mirry, it is left to you personally; not
to us as a family,” said Ronald.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Well, what of that? What do I want with
money, except to save the dear home for us all?”
she cried, half indignantly, half in exultation.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Dear, unselfish child!” her grandmother
exclaimed, gazing at her through tear-dimmed
eyes; “but we must not let you rob yourself.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“You needn’t be one bit afraid I shall do
that, granny dear,” Miriam cried, springing to
her feet and throwing her arms about the old
lady’s neck; “I’ll be sure to look out for number
one.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“When are you going to begin so doing,
sister mine?” asked Ronald, with a good-humored
laugh.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_186' id='Page_186'>186</a></span>
Bertie and Olive came running in from the
garden with the announcement that the captain
was coming.</p>

<p class='c009' >“To see you, Mirry,” added Ronald, roguishly.
“I presume he wishes a private interview.
Let me beg of you to treat him well
for my sake. Just think what a friend he has
been to me!”</p>

<p class='c009' >“He comes on this business of the will, I presume,”
returned Miriam, blushing, “and I shall
want you and grandmother to be present.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Then I’ll ask him into the sitting-room,”
Ronald said, giving her a smiling, mischievous
look as he hastened away to receive his
friend.</p>

<p class='c009' >Charlton did not ask for a private interview,
or seem to have come upon any other errand
than the matter of the will. What he had to
say was said in the presence of Mrs. Heath and
Ronald.</p>

<p class='c009' >He told them there was apparently nothing
in the way of Miriam’s taking immediate possession
of the property. It was possible the
widow might come forward to put in a claim to
her thirds, but not probable, as she was doubtless
keeping herself in concealment for fear of
being put upon her trial on a charge of complicity
in the first attempt upon the old man’s
life, he having many times strongly asserted
that she was guilty.</p>

<p class='c009' >“And,” added Charlton, “there is no doubt
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_187' id='Page_187'>187</a></span>
that she was an old flame of the would-be murderer,
Phelim O’Rourke, or that they were
often together when the old husband was absent
from home.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“What news do you bring us from town this
morning?” asked Ronald. “What has been
done with Bangs’s body?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Wiley, his brother-in-law, had it taken
down last night and buried as privately as
possible, lest there should be some interference
on the part of the lynchers; though I do not,
myself, think he need have had any such apprehension,
they being fully satisfied, I have no
doubt, with having inflicted the death penalty
for his crimes.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Do you approve of capital punishment, captain?”
asked Mrs. Heath.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes, madam, I do,” he said, emphatically;
“first, because God commands it—‘Whoso
sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood
be shed’—and, secondly, because its abolition
gives encouragement to those inclined to commit
murder—from enmity or for gain—and leads
to lynching in cases where the indignation of
the community is so aroused by the enormity of
a crime, or a series of crimes, that they feel
that the criminal must be sent where he can no
longer harm his fellows, and that nothing short
of the death penalty is an adequate reward for
his misdeeds.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I agree with you,” returned Mrs. Heath;
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_188' id='Page_188'>188</a></span>
“it is not worth while for man to try to be
wiser or more merciful than his Maker.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Where is the command to which you have
referred?” asked Ronald. “Do not those who
are opposed to capital punishment assert that it
was a part of the Levitical law, and that therefore
the obligation to obey it has passed away?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Some do,” said Charlton, “but it must be
from ignorance of the time when the command
was given, and to whom. It is found in the
ninth chapter of Genesis, fifth and sixth verses.</p>

<p class='c009' >“The fact that it was given to Noah just after
the flood shows that it is binding upon all mankind;
for Noah was the progenitor of all races
of men now living upon the face of the earth.
Some opposers of capital punishment say, to be
sure, that the words are to be understood in the
sense of a prediction, not a command; but to
my mind it is very clear that they are the latter.
Let me read you the passage,” he continued,
taking up a Bible that lay on a table near which
he was seated, and turning over its pages.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Do; we shall be glad to hear it,” answered
Mrs. Heath; and he complied.</p>

<p class='c009' >“‘And surely your blood of your lives will
I require: at the hand of every beast will I require
it, and at the hand of man; at the hand
of every man’s brother will I require the life of
man. Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man
shall his blood be shed; for in the image of
God made He man.’”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_189' id='Page_189'>189</a></span>
Closing the book, “Is it not a plain command?”
he asked; “and being, as I have already
remarked, given to him by whose descendants
the whole earth was to be peopled—given
hundreds of years before Abraham, the
progenitor of the Jews, was born—it is evidently
not merely a part of the Levitical law,
but is to this day as binding as ever upon all
mankind, Jew and Gentile alike.</p>

<p class='c009' >“It is a dangerous thing,” he went on, “for
men to disregard any law of God; probably
yesterday’s lynching would not have occurred
had not the outraged community felt that there
was no hope of justice upon the criminal through
the operation of the law of the State; and I fear
we may be going to have more of the same kind
of work; the popular feeling against O’Rourke
is very strong all up and down the valley.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Do you think there will be an attempt to
lynch him?” asked Ronald, while the faces of
the two ladies turned pale with apprehension.</p>

<p class='c009' >“I hope not, but I certainly fear it,” replied
the captain; “there are angry mutterings in
the air that seem to presage a coming storm.”</p>

<p class='c009' >There was a pause in the conversation, broken
by Ronald. “I quite agree with you, Warren,
in what you have been saying about the mischievous
tendency of abolishing capital punishment;
mercy to the few (that is, mercy to those
whom the law of God adjudges to death for
having destroyed the lives of their fellow-creatures)
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_190' id='Page_190'>190</a></span>
is cruelty to the many, because it, as you
have said, takes away the wholesome fear that
often deters wicked and unscrupulous men from
murders they are moved to commit from covetousness
or a desire for revenge.</p>

<p class='c009' >“But do you not think that beside the evil,
of which we have just been speaking, there are
others at work in the same direction?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes; I have in mind two others which are,
I presume, the very ones to which you refer.
One is the practice by criminal lawyers of delaying
or entirely frustrating the execution of the
law when they know their client to be guilty;
and not only guilty, but unrepentant; taking
advantage, for that purpose, of some trivial
technicality that has no bearing whatever upon
the question of the prisoner’s guilt.</p>

<p class='c009' >“The higher courts, too, that for like insufficient
reasons reverse the righteous decisions of
the lower, give encouragement to crime.</p>

<p class='c009' >“The other evil, working in the same direction,
is the mawkish sentimentality of certain
weak-minded people, that leads them to make
heroes and martyrs of the most depraved and
guilty of men, the most heartless and desperate
of criminals. Red-handed murderers seem to be
their especial favorites, to be visited, feasted
upon dainties, loaded with choice flowers, pitied
and pleaded for, that they may be spared the
due reward of their deeds; perhaps set free to
repeat them.”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_191' id='Page_191'>191</a></span>
“I blush for my sex when I hear how some
of them pet and pamper the vilest criminals,
the most heartless, ruffianly murderers, simply
because justice has overtaken them and they are
in prison,” remarked Miriam. “They, the silly
sentimentalists, seem to lose all remembrance
of the pain and misery endured by the wretched
victims of the criminals, in weak, not to say
wicked, commiseration for the richly deserved
pains and penalties the assassins have brought
upon themselves.”</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008' >Belinda Himes was still in hiding in the
cave on the river-bank where she had taken
refuge at the first. She found it a doleful
abode, but scarcely dared venture from it except
under cover of the night, when with the owl
and the bat she sallied forth from her lair to
prowl about the country in search of food. The
supply she had taken with her from the raft had
long since become exhausted, and she was on
the verge of starvation.</p>

<p class='c009' >Thus pressed by hunger, she visited fields,
gardens, and hen-roosts by night, appropriating
to her own use such eggs, vegetables, and fruits
as she could lay hands upon and carry away—sometimes
even going so far as to abstract a
young chicken.</p>

<p class='c009' >Fortunately there were fish in the river, and
having found rod, line, and a hook or two on
the raft, she was able occasionally to catch one.
So she managed to keep soul and body together,
yet not very much more than that.</p>

<p class='c009' >It was a dreadful life she led—a life filled with
terror, remorse, and despair. Afraid to be
seen by mortal eye, she crouched in her dark,
damp, unwholesome den through the long,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_193' id='Page_193'>193</a></span>
bright summer days, shut away from all the
beauty and fragrance that gladdened the hearts
and lives of those whom sin and crime did not
compel to hide from the light of the sun, and
away from the companionship of their kind.</p>

<p class='c009' >Oh, how wearily the days and nights dragged
along! Life under such conditions seemed
little worth, yet death a thing to shrink from in
wild affright.</p>

<p class='c009' >She saw no one and knew nothing of passing
events. She supposed her husband was still
living, and wondered if, when he should be able
to be about again, he would make an effort to
find her, and have her brought to trial for the
crime of which he had accused her.</p>

<p class='c009' >She thought much of Phelim, and longed to
see and talk with him; but it did not seem
likely they would ever meet again; if convicted,
he would doubtless be given a long term
in the penitentiary; perhaps it would be a life
sentence. She was glad it could be nothing
worse; hanging was, to her way of thinking,
far more to be dreaded.</p>

<p class='c009' >She would have gone to Prairieville and to the
jail, seeking an interview with him, could she
have done so with safety to herself; but she
dared not, lest she should be made to share his
imprisonment, both there and in the State
prison.</p>

<p class='c009' >One day—the same on which Captain Charlton
carried to Miriam the news that Himes had
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_194' id='Page_194'>194</a></span>
made a will in her favor—Belinda, lying asleep
in her cave, was awakened by the sound of
voices at the foot of the bank. She started with
affright, a cold perspiration bursting out all
over her, and her heart beating wildly. She
thought they were climbing up to her retreat;
perhaps had dogged her steps as she returned to
it some hours before, and had come to arrest her.</p>

<p class='c009' >But after listening intently for a few minutes,
she decided that they were stationary; probably
seated near the water’s edge and engaged
in fishing, which was indeed the case.</p>

<p class='c009' >Then she lay down again with her ear close
to the overhanging vines, that she might catch
every word of their talk.</p>

<p class='c009' >They were speaking of Mr. Himes, and as
she listened with breathless interest, she presently
learned of the second and successful attempt
upon his life. She drew a breath of relief,
as she remembered that he would have been
the principal witness against Phelim.</p>

<p class='c009' >But what were they saying now? That
Phelim was suspected of having instigated the
murder, and that there was talk of lynching
him, as Bangs had been lynched only the day
before for shooting Barney Nolan down dead.</p>

<p class='c009' >Horrible! horrible! She was almost wild
with terror on Phelim’s account. Oh, if she
could only warn him! if she could only help
him to escape from the jail before the lynchers
got there!</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_195' id='Page_195'>195</a></span>
Alas! that was impossible; but perhaps there
would be no attempt to harm him, and if she
were in that neighborhood she might go near to
the jail in the night, when his keepers would be
asleep, and in some way attract his attention,
so that he would come to his cell window and
speak to her. She would venture a good deal
even to hear his voice.</p>

<p class='c009' >She fell asleep while thinking of it, for she
was weary with the wanderings of the past
night, and must wait for the sheltering wing of
darkness before setting out upon the contemplated
journey; and she had no preparation to
make in the way of packing, except to gather
together her few possessions into a small bundle
that she could carry in her hand.</p>

<p class='c009' >She rested through the remainder of the day,
and when the sunset glow had faded from the
sky, and darkness began creeping over the
landscape, crawled from her hiding-place and
started upon her toilsome tramp, following the
course of the river, which she knew would
finally bring her to her destination.</p>

<p class='c009' >There was a more direct route, but she was not
acquainted with it, and dared not make inquiries.</p>

<p class='c009' >Feeble from mental suffering and lack of sufficient
nourishment, she could not travel fast.
Two nights of journeying, lying by during the
days, brought her at last to the vicinity of
Prairieville.</p>

<p class='c009' >Day was breaking when she arrived. She
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_196' id='Page_196'>196</a></span>
lay concealed in the woods through that day
and evening, till nearly every light in the town
was extinguished, excepting the street lamps,
then made her way cautiously to the jail, which
stood upon the outskirts, partly surrounded by
a grove of trees.</p>

<p class='c009' >All was darkness and silence there; probably
keeper and prisoners were asleep.</p>

<p class='c009' >Slowly she made the circuit of the building,
gazing up at the grated windows and trying to
conjecture which was the one belonging to
Phelim’s cell.</p>

<p class='c009' >She possessed no clew to it, and even could
she decide which it was, how was she to attract
his attention without betraying her vicinity to
others?</p>

<p class='c009' >Suddenly she remembered that she could
imitate very closely the note of the katydid,
and that Phelim had once heard her doing so,
and complimented her on the accomplishment.
She tried it now, stationing herself opposite a
cell window, which, as it happened, was the one
she sought.</p>

<p class='c009' >She had repeated the note several times, when
at last it was answered in kind; then a voice,
speaking in suppressed tones, asked, “Is it
yersilf, me darlint?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes, it’s me, Phalim,” she replied, in a joyous
whisper, stepping close under the window
as she spoke. “Oh, if I could only help you
out o’ that!”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_197' id='Page_197'>197</a></span>
“Who knows but mabbe ye kin in toime, me
jewel,” he said. “We’ll set our wits to wurruk,
me darlint. If I had a file now, to hilp me to
git rid o’ wan or two o’ these bars, it’s not so
hard ’twud be to break jail. Thin we’d fly
the counthry together, an’ lave throuble behind
us.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I’d risk anything to help you,” she responded,
“but how or where I could get a file
I don’t see, for I daren’t venture to show myself
to a livin’ soul.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Is that so, me jewel? But what fer darsen’t
ye?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Because he swore I’d a hand in robbin’ an’
murderin’ him.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Who? that ould divil Himes? Well, he’s
out o’ the way now.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes; but maybe they’ll arrest me an’ try
me fer it, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Bangs’ll git ye off if they do,” he said,
with a low chuckle. “He’s promised to bring
me off wid flyin’ colors.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“But—but—he—he’s dead—Bangs is; they’ve
lynched him, don’t ye know?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Niver heard a wurrud o’ it. Whan?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Four days ago.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“An’ that’s the fuss they wuz makin’ down
the strate whan I heerd ’em shoutin’ an’ yellin’,
loike so manny divils! I axed the jailor what
all the noise wuz about, but he answered me
niver a wurrud—jist walked away wid his head
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_198' id='Page_198'>198</a></span>
up an’ his mouth toight shut. An’ here I’ve
been a wonderin’ an’ scoldin’ bekase Bangs
didn’t show hisself an’ lat me know how the
bizniss was progressin’; how fast he wuz gittin’
ready to prove till the coort an’ jury that
Phalim O’Rourke wuz as innercent o’ that attimpt
on the ould man’s loife as an unborn
babby.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“But he’s dead, and who’ll clear ye now?”
she asked, mournfully.</p>

<p class='c009' >“I’ll have to break jail, an’ ye must help me,
B’lindy.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“If I only could,” she said, and her voice
was weak and trembling; “but I’m half dead
now; I can hardly stand fer weakness. I’ve
been hidin’ in a damp, dark, dirty cave—the
one you told me of—an’ I’m nearly starved;
haven’t had enough to eat since—since that
night on the raft. If ’twas light enough for
you to see me, you’d never know me; I’m
wasted to skin an’ bone, an’ my clo’es are all
rags an’ dirt.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Did I iver hear the loike!” he exclaimed.
“Well, niver moind, me jewel; whan I’m a free
man agin I’ll soon have ye a wearin’ yer foine
silks an’ satins an’ goold ornamints, an’ drivin’
in yer kerridge, mabbe, loike anny lady in the
land.”</p>

<p class='c009' >She sighed despairingly. “But you’ll never
be able to break out o’ this; an’ there’s nobody
now to defend ye on yer trial. They say ’twas
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_199' id='Page_199'>199</a></span>
some o’ your band that finished Himes; they
say ’twas by your orderin’. Is that so?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Mabbe,” he chuckled; “the byes knowed
me moind on that p’int; an’ they knowed the
ould divil wad be the wan to swear away me
liberty, if he’d a chance; but dead men tells no
tales.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I wisht they’d let him live,” she sighed;
“’twould have been better fer you.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Then she went on to tell him what she had
overheard the men at the river say about the
probability of an attempt to lynch him.</p>

<p class='c009' >While this talk was going on at the jail window,
a wagon filled with masked and armed
men was driving toward the town from the
direction of Fairfield, another along the road
leading from Frederic, a third coming from
Riverside, while a fourth waited at the bridge
over the river at Prairieville, where the other
three presently joined it. Then falling into
line, they drove up the street that led to the jail.</p>

<p class='c009' >As they neared the building the creaking of
their wheels struck upon Belinda’s ear.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Oh, what’s that?” she cried, in startled
tones, though half under her breath. “Wagons—one,
two, three, four—and stoppin’ right out
there, every one of ’em!”</p>

<p class='c009' >“So they are, an’ all’s up wid me!” cried
Phelim, hoarsely, adding a volley of oaths, as
he grasped the bars and shook them fiercely in
the frantic but vain effort to wrench them off.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_200' id='Page_200'>200</a></span>
The men were already alighting and pouring
into the jail yard; then came a thundering
knock upon the outer door, accompanied by a
demand for instant admittance.</p>

<p class='c009' >The trembling pair at the cell window were
still listening, Phelim clinging to the bars,
Belinda leaning heavily against the outer wall,
while her heart beat almost to suffocation and
her breath came gaspingly. They heard a second-story
window raised and the jailor’s voice
in parley with the would-be intruders.</p>

<p class='c009' >“What is wanted, gentlemen?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Admittance; come down and open the
door,” answered the spokesman of the party.</p>

<p class='c009' >“We don’t admit visitors at this time o’
night,” said the jailor.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Come down and open the door, or we’ll
break it in,” was the response, in a tone of
fierce determination.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Who are you?” asked the jailor.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Himes’s avengers. Give the murderer into
our hands, and we ask nothing more.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Can’t do it, gentlemen. He’s been committed
to my care by the officers of the law,
and I’ve no right to give him up to any one
else.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“We don’t offer you any choice in the matter;
you’ll open to us and give him up, or
we’ll break in and take him in spite of you.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Again the jailor refused to accede to their
demand; then thundering blows of axes and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_201' id='Page_201'>201</a></span>
hammers wielded by strong arms fell fast and
thick on the door, the noise resounding through
the building and striking terror to every hearer
within its walls.</p>

<p class='c009' >At length the door gave way, the assailants
poured into the hall and seized the jailor, who
had come down, lamp in hand, and would have
tried to persuade them to resign their purpose;
but they would not hear a word from him. As
he refused to give up his keys, they bound him
hand and foot and took forcible possession of
them, then hastened to the cell wherein their
intended victim was confined.</p>

<p class='c009' >The noise of the struggle with the jailor, the
tramp of heavy feet traversing the corridors,
the fitting of the key in the lock of the cell
door, all reached the ears of Phelim and Belinda,
causing both their hearts to quake with terror.
Belinda held her breath to listen, while trembling
so that she could scarce keep from falling to the
ground.</p>

<p class='c009' >The heavy door of the cell swung back, and
for a moment the little apartment was flooded
with light from a lamp held high in the hand of
one of the masked intruders.</p>

<p class='c009' >He stood aside while four or five of his company
filed rapidly in, and laid hold of the prisoner
with no gentle hands.</p>

<p class='c009' >Phelim saw at a glance that resistance was
useless. With a face pale as death, eyes almost
ready to start from their sockets, quivering
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_202' id='Page_202'>202</a></span>
lips, and in a tone that he vainly endeavored to
make steady and defiant, “What are yees afther,
sors?” he demanded. “Yees haven’t anny
roight to be comin’ in here, fer I’m undher the
pertection o’ the law.”</p>

<p class='c009' >But even while he spoke they had pinioned
his arms, and now surrounding him, they led
him out through the corridors, the outer door,
the jail-yard, and into the grove, where they
halted with him under a large oak-tree.</p>

<p class='c009' >A man was seated on its largest branch with
a rope in his hand, one end of which he had
already attached to the limb; at the other was
a noose, which was quickly adjusted about
Phelim’s neck; then he was forced to mount
into a wagon that had been driven up under
the tree.</p>

<p class='c009' >He kicked, cursed, and swore fearful oaths,
but found resistance vain; strong hands pulled,
pushed, and lifted him into the vehicle and held
him there.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Now,” said a stern voice, “you have but
five minutes to live; better stop cursing and
spend your breath in prayer.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yees are murtherin’ me; ye’re goin’ further
nor the law o’ the State, black-hearted scoundrels
that ye are!” he cried, fiercely.</p>

<p class='c009' >“You are receiving the due reward of your
deeds,” answered the voice. “The minutes
are going; better spend your last breath in an
effort to save your soul.”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_203' id='Page_203'>203</a></span>
The curses died on the lips of the ruffian; he
looked up at the starlit sky, down and around
on the crowd of dark figures and masked faces.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Gintlemen, hain’t none o’ yees got no pity
fer the ould mither and fayther that hasn’t niver
a sowl to wurruk fer ’em an’ suppoort ’em in
their fable ould age, barrin’ their only son as
stands here wid a rope round his neck?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c009' >“A son who has supported them by robbery
and murder!” cried the same stern voice that
had spoken before. “The time is up. Your
blood be on your own head!” it added, and at
a signal the wagon moved from under the culprit,
and left him dangling high in air, the
noose tightening about his neck.</p>

<p class='c009' >The stern executioners stood watching him
by the light of their lanterns till fully satisfied
that life was extinct, then crowded into their
wagons and drove away as they had come.</p>

<p class='c009' >At the moment of their entrance into the cell
Belinda staggered back into the shadow of a
tree, at some little distance from the one they
had selected as a gallows, from which, in an
agony of woe, she witnessed the whole dreadful
scene. She was in terror for herself, lest she
might be made to share Phelim’s fate, yet that
fear was almost swallowed up for the time in
the anguish of grief for him that wrung her
heart, as she looked upon the tragedy that
ended the earthly life of the man she still
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_204' id='Page_204'>204</a></span>
loved, deeply dyed villain though she knew him
to be.</p>

<p class='c009' >She clung to the tree for support, while eye
and ear were intent to catch every expression
of his countenance and tone of his voice. But
the flickering light of the lanterns gave her only
fitful glimpses of his features, and the oaths and
curses that fell from his lips were not such
words as even she would desire to treasure up
in her memory, for they inspired her with no
hope that he was going to a better and happier
world.</p>

<p class='c009' >When she saw the wagon driven from under
him, and knew that the deed was accomplished,
she fell in a heap at the foot of the tree to
which she had been clinging, and knew nothing
more till roused to consciousness by the
sound of the wheels of the departing vehicles.</p>

<p class='c009' >Feebly she raised herself to a sitting posture,
then glanced fearfully around till fully convinced
that the self-constituted executioners
were gone not to return; then, getting upon
her feet like one who had scarce strength to
move, she dragged herself to the other tree,
where the body was hanging.</p>

<p class='c009' >It was swaying slowly in the night wind.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Phelim!” she cried, hoarsely—“Phelim,
speak to me! Oh, it can’t be that ye’ll never
speak again! Yes, he’s dead; they’d never
leave him till they was sure o’ that! Oh, me
heart’s broke! I ain’t got nothin’ to live fer
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_205' id='Page_205'>205</a></span>
no more! I might’s well a let ’em hang me,
too!” and weeping, shuddering, tottering with
weakness, she crept away to her hiding-place
in the woods.</p>

<p class='c009' >She had no bed but the ground, no covering
save the starry canopy of heaven; she had no
earthly friend, and had never cared to seek the
friendship of that One “who sticketh closer
than a brother.”</p>

<p class='c009' >How utterly lonely and desolate she felt as
she lay moaning and groaning upon her hard
couch, weeping as if she would weep her very
life away, longing to lay down the burdens and
sorrows of life, yet shrinking in unspeakable
terror from the thought of death.</p>

<p class='c009' >Some words that she had heard, she knew not
when or where, kept sounding in her ears,
“The way of transgressors is hard.” “The
wages of sin is death.” How the truth of those
inspired declarations had been verified in
Bangs’s case, in Phelim’s, and in her own!</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_206' id='Page_206'>206</a></span>
  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008' >Two days after the death of Bangs, Mr. Wiley
went for his wife, who was visiting acquaintances
a day’s journey from home.</p>

<p class='c009' >He shrank from the task of telling her the
story of the dreadful scenes enacted in Prairieville
during her absence, but the tidings had
preceded him, and he found her lying on a
couch in strong hysterics.</p>

<p class='c009' >She greeted him with bitter reproaches—“Why
had he not exerted himself to save poor,
dear Avery from the fury of the mob?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I couldn’t,” he said; “you might just as
reasonably ask me why I do not prevent the
lightning from striking where it will.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Don’t talk in that way to me!” she cried,
in passionate tones; “you didn’t try; you
didn’t make the slightest effort; the papers
would have said so if you had; you were too
great a coward to lift a finger to save him.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Have it your own way,” he returned,
gloomily; “it’s a thousand pities you were not
there to quell the fury of the mob, and turn
them from so many tigers, thirsting for blood,
into lambs; you could have done it, of course;
there’s nothing you can’t do, except treat your
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_207' id='Page_207'>207</a></span>
husband decently,” he added, with bitter emphasis.</p>

<p class='c009' >It pleased her to ignore that last clause of his
reply.</p>

<p class='c009' >“I’d have tried, anyhow,” she said; “I’d
have helped him to escape from them. Where
is he now?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“You are as capable of deciding that question
as I,” he answered, turning away with a
slight shudder.</p>

<p class='c009' >“You misunderstand me wilfully,” she said,
her eyes flashing with anger. “I want to know
what you have done with his body.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Buried it,” he returned, laconically.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Buried it? without consulting me! without
letting me know! without giving me time to
attend the funeral! How dared you, Amos
Wiley!”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I thought that, under the peculiar circumstances,
the best thing to be done was to put
the body into the ground as quietly and with
as little fuss as possible; and he would not have
been a pleasant sight for you to look upon.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“What do you mean, Amos Wiley?” she demanded,
starting up to a sitting posture and
regarding him with looks of fury and indignation;
“that you had no funeral services, but
gave him, my brother, the burial of a dog?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I had no thought of that,” he said; “I laid
him away decently and quietly, that was all.
I did not suppose you would feel like having a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_208' id='Page_208'>208</a></span>
funeral, considering how the neighbors and all
the townspeople must have regarded his death,
and—and the cause of it.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“You mean that they thought him disgraced,
and that I’d feel ashamed of him and of—of
what he did, and the way he lost his life? No
such thing! I consider him a martyr, and
should have gloried in showing everybody that
I thought so.”</p>

<p class='c009' >He gave her a look of utter astonishment.</p>

<p class='c009' >“You needn’t look at me so!” she cried.
“He killed that impudent Irishman in self-defence;
I know he did!”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Self-defence! The man was doing nothing
but walking peaceably along the street behind
him, attending to his own business.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Were you alongside? Did you see and
hear it all?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“No; but there were credible witnesses who
did; and if the shooting had not been so unprovoked,
the bystanders would not have become
the furious mob that they instantly did.
I tell you, Dora, you had best keep quiet about
the whole affair, and, in fact, I think it may be
our wisest course to move away to some distant
part of the country, where the story will
not be likely to follow us.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I shall do nothing of the sort,” she said.
“It would be a losing business to sell out our
property in Prairieville and go to a new place.
‘A rolling stone gathers no moss.’ I’ll go
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_209' id='Page_209'>209</a></span>
home; we’ll start directly, and I’ll let the
neighbors see that I don’t feel myself in the
least disgraced by what has passed.”</p>

<p class='c009' >They reached Prairieville in the evening of
the same day that Belinda arrived in the vicinity.
Early the next morning Mr. Wiley went
down-town on some errand. Returning half
an hour later, he appeared before his wife with
a ghastly and disturbed countenance.</p>

<p class='c009' >“What are we coming to?” he sighed, wiping
the perspiration from his forehead. “There
was—another lynching—last night; armed,
masked men—four wagon loads of them—broke
into the jail, took Phelim O’Rourke and hung
him to a tree right there alongside of the building;
and his body’s swinging there yet, they
say. I believe they are about taking it down,
however, and home to the old folks. They’ve
held an inquest, and the verdict is that he came
to his death by the hands of persons unknown.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Dreadful!” she cried. “But who did it?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Nobody seems to know or wants to know.
I’ve told you what the verdict of the coroner
was; but it’s said the best citizens of this town
and Frederic, Riverside, and Fairfield had a
hand in it. You see they knew the law would
never hang him, and were determined he should
have his deserts; not only to punish him, but
to discourage other scoundrels from following
his example.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Well, I’m glad! He ought to have been
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_210' id='Page_210'>210</a></span>
hung; if it hadn’t been for him Avery would
be alive to-day; but my poor brother sacrificed
himself to save that miserable wretch from
being sent to State prison.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Sacrificed himself by swearing to a lie,”
was her husband’s inward comment, but aloud
he merely remarked that he pitied O’Rourke’s
parents.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes, of course you do,” snapped his wife;
“you are always ready to feel for anybody but
those nearest to you. You have no sympathy
to waste upon May and me, but those low, vulgar
Irish people are objects of the deepest commiseration.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I have done my best to show sympathy
with you and your niece, Dora,” he returned;
“but you are never just to your unfortunate
husband.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Unfortunate because he has me for a wife,
I presume you mean,” she retorted, flashing an
angry glance at him. “Breakfast has been
waiting for you till it must be completely spoiled.
Come and eat, if you can find an appetite after
such heartless treatment of your wife.”</p>

<p class='c009' >She led the way to the table, he following in
silence, having learned by past experience the
utter uselessness of trying to have the last word
in a controversy with her.</p>

<p class='c009' >“You don’t eat as if you relished your food
the least bit,” she remarked, after watching
him furtively for a few minutes; “but if you
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_211' id='Page_211'>211</a></span>
don’t find it palatable it’s your own fault for
keeping it waiting so long.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I have no complaint to make,” he answered,
“but I am too sick at heart over the
awful doings we’ve had in this town of late to
feel much appetite for the daintiest of food.”
With that he rose and left the table and the house.</p>

<p class='c009' >Coming in some hours later, he found his
wife in what had been the private office of her
brother, looking over his papers.</p>

<p class='c009' >“I’m not exactly sure that you have a right
to be at those, Dora,” he remarked, in a tone
of mild expostulation.</p>

<p class='c009' >“I’d like to know who has a better!” she
retorted, straightening herself with an angry,
defiant look up into his face, as he came and
stood at her side. “I’m Avery’s nearest of
kin, and therefore his heir.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“But there may be a will.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“No; there isn’t. I’ve hunted everywhere,
and there’s nothing of the kind to be found.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Still, even in that case you are not his only
heir.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I am, though; for we two were the last of
the family.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes; but you forget that May inherits her
mother’s share.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“She sha’n’t! I won’t hear of it! That chit
of a child, indeed! She’ll get it when I’m
gone, if she outlives me, but I shall hold on to
it till then.”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_212' id='Page_212'>212</a></span>
“But you can’t, unless there’s a will leaving
it all to you; for otherwise the law will give
her an equal share.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“But if we don’t choose to let anybody know
what he has left?” she asked, frowningly, yet
with some slight hesitation.</p>

<p class='c009' >“There, now,” said her husband, “don’t you
see why you have no right to come here alone
and examine his effects?”</p>

<p class='c009' >She opened her hand, showing a roll of bank-notes.</p>

<p class='c009' >“This ready money I ought to have a right
to take, to use for May and myself, and I’m
going to do it; we need it at once to buy our
mourning and other things.”</p>

<p class='c009' >He looked troubled, for though honest and
upright in his dealings, he yet dreaded to oppose
her will.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Let me see those notes,” he requested, holding
out his hand.</p>

<p class='c009' >She allowed him to take them, remarking as
he did so, “It’s quite a nice sum—considerably
over a thousand dollars.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes,” he said, turning them about with careful
scrutiny, “but—”</p>

<p class='c009' >“What?” she asked, sharply.</p>

<p class='c009' >“They’re all marked; they’re the missing
notes stolen from Lakeside; I know, for I’ve
had a particular description of them from Sandy
McAllister.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Well?”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_213' id='Page_213'>213</a></span>
“Of course we must restore them to the
rightful owners; we wouldn’t be guilty of fraud,
and we couldn’t use these bills without detection,
even if we didn’t care for the dishonesty
of appropriating them.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“But that girl!” she hissed through her
clinched teeth; “she rejected my brother, and
I’m determined she shall be punished for it.
Here’s a mortgage on Lakeside,” laying her
hand on the paper as she spoke; “Avery
bought it to have her in his power, and he told
me he’d foreclose and turn them out of house
and home if the saucy minx held out against
his advances. Now it’s my property, and I
mean to foreclose without giving her any alternative;
then the place will be mine, and we’ll
go there and live. I’ve always had a hankering
after it; it’s the prettiest place in all the region
round, to my way of thinking.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“But, Dora, you couldn’t really contemplate
so mean, not to say dishonest a procedure?”
he exclaimed, in surprise and dismay.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Dishonest!” she cried, with rising wrath;
“where’s the dishonesty? Haven’t I a right
to foreclose and sell the property to get my
money if they don’t pay up their interest?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“But they will when we hand them these bills,
which we know to have been stolen from them.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Hand them the notes and let them know
they were found among Avery’s possessions,
and have them blackening his character—telling
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_214' id='Page_214'>214</a></span>
that he was the thief or the receiver, that’s as
bad as the thief?” she exclaimed, with fury.
“I’ll do no such thing; I’ll defend my brother’s
character to the last gasp!” she added, with
virtuous indignation.</p>

<p class='c009' >He turned away and paced the room back and
forth for a few moments; then, returning to her
side, “Dora,” he said, with unwonted decision,
“to keep back these notes from the rightful
owners would be as bad as stealing, and I will
be no party to any such dishonest dealing.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“You’ve nothing whatever to do with it,”
she interrupted, hotly.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Unfortunately I have,” he responded, “and
I insist on taking to the Heaths this property,
which is rightfully theirs. I shall tell them we
do not know or understand how these notes
happened to be found here among your brother’s
papers, and shall try to exact from them a
promise not to reveal the fact to any one. I
think I shall have no difficulty in persuading
them to that.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Then we’ll lose the place,” she said, grinding
her teeth with rage. “I’ll not consent.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“We can’t lose what we never owned,” he
returned; “and I for one could never enjoy it
if gained by means so unfair and cruel.”</p>

<p class='c009' >She continued her opposition for some time
longer, but to her unbounded astonishment
found him for once firm in his determination not
to surrender to her will.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_215' id='Page_215'>215</a></span>
He presently took the notes from her unwilling
hand and forthwith departed for Lakeside.</p>

<p class='c009' >Great was the joy there when his errand was
made known and accomplished. The promise
he asked for was readily given, accompanied
with hearty thanks for the restoration of the
notes.</p>

<p class='c009' >Then Miriam said, “Mr. Bangs told me he
had bought the mortgage on our place, and
now we would like to buy it of his heirs; the
money is ready to be paid down at any time.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I am glad to hear it,” returned Mr. Wiley,
emphatically, “and I think the matter can be
arranged very shortly.”</p>

<p class='c009' >When he had taken his departure the grandmother,
Miriam, and Ronald exchanged looks
and words of congratulation; their hearts were
full of joy.</p>

<p class='c009' >“We must get Warren to attend to this business
for us, grandmother and Mirry,” Ronald
said, giving his sister a mischievous, bantering
look as he concluded his sentence.</p>

<p class='c009' >“I think we could not do better,” Mrs.
Heath replied, turning an inquiring glance upon
her granddaughter.</p>

<p class='c009' >“I entirely agree with you, grandma,” rejoined
Miriam, quietly. “Suppose you write
him a note stating the facts, Ronald, of course
keeping back the one we have promised not to
reveal.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Certainly; with all my heart,” returned
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_216' id='Page_216'>216</a></span>
the young man. “I shall urge him to call at
once and give us his opinion and advice. By
the way, he hasn’t been here since he came to
tell you the good news in regard to Himes’s
will.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Miriam did not seem to hear. She had caught
sight of a carriage nearing their gate, and hurried
out to receive Dr. Jasper and Serena, who,
she perceived, were its occupants.</p>

<p class='c009' >These good friends were soon told of the
good fortune that had come to the Lakeside
family, and responded to the tidings with hearty
congratulations and good wishes.</p>

<p class='c009' >A good deal of lively, cheery chat followed,
and for a short space Miriam seemed as gay as
the rest, but erelong Serena noticed an expression
of deep sadness steal over her speaking
countenance, when for a moment the stream of
talk had drifted past her, and she was unaware
that any eye was regarding her.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Miriam, my dear, won’t you invite me into
your garden to look at your roses?” Serena
asked, with one of her winsome smiles.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Certainly; I shall be delighted to show
them,” Miriam answered, a bright, pleased
look taking the place of the former sorrowful
one, as she rose and led the way. “The doctor
may come, too, if he likes.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“No, no, he mayn’t! I want you to myself
for a little while,” said Serena, laughingly.
“Please just stay where you are, Alonzo, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_217' id='Page_217'>217</a></span>
do your best to entertain Mrs. Heath and Mr.
Ronald.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Roses of many beautiful varieties formed a
prominent feature of the flower-garden at Lakeside.
Serena went about among them exclaiming,
admiring, asking questions in regard to
names and the proper treatment for bringing
them to perfection, but in the midst of it all
turned suddenly upon her friend with the query,
“What’s the matter with you, my dear? Why
are you sad now, when delivered from your
tormentor and provided with a small fortune
over and above what it will take to clear off the
mortgage that has given you so much anxiety
and heartache?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Why do you think me sad, Mrs. Serena?”
returned Miriam, with playful look and tone,
though a bright blush mantled her cheek.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Oh, I have eyes,” was the laconic answer.</p>

<p class='c009' >“And do they tell you I am sad?” asked
Miriam, smiling brightly.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Not at this moment, my sweet, pretty maid;
but they caught a different look a while ago
from that presented to them now. Am I right
in my conjecture that the course of true love
does not run smooth? Pray believe, dear, that
I do not ask from any vulgar curiosity, but
from a sincere desire and hope to be able to
give both sympathy and help,” she added, taking
Miriam’s hand and pressing it affectionately
in both of hers. “That Warren Charlton is
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_218' id='Page_218'>218</a></span>
deeply enamored of you I am positively certain,
and as he, too, is looking woebegone without
apparent reason, to what other conclusion can
I come than that the roughness of true love’s
course is making misery for you both?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Captain Charlton has never breathed a word
of love to me,” Miriam said, blushing more
vividly than before, “so of course there has
been no lover’s quarrel between us; but surely
the horrors of the last week are enough to account
for a feeling of depression, especially in
one who—Oh, Serena, I think you do not
know that it was I who had put Bangs into
such a rage that he shot poor Barney Nolan,
and was lynched in consequence! Oh, I cannot
yet get over the feeling that I—I am partly
to blame—partly responsible for it all!” she
added, averting her face, while the big tears
rolled down her cheeks.</p>

<p class='c009' >“And that was what made you look so overwhelmed
when you heard the news of that lynching!”
cried Serena, catching her friend in her
arms and holding her close. “Ah! I knew very
well it could not possibly be that you cared in
the very least for that double-dyed villain and
cowardly assassin; but I could not divest Warren
Charlton of some slight lingering suspicion
or fear that you might have had some little
liking for him.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I knew it!” cried Miriam, her eyes filling
with tears of mingled grief and indignation;
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_219' id='Page_219'>219</a></span>
“I felt how grossly he misunderstood my emotion
on hearing of the awful fate of the man who
was my worst enemy, and whom I so thoroughly
detested. But, oh, how could he, how
could he for a moment think that I could have
any admiration for the man whose character
you have so truly described?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“It’s a perfect shame that he should,” said
Serena; “but I’ll set him right on that point.
Oh, you needn’t give me such a frightened,
beseeching look, my child; I’ve no notion of
compromising you by affording him the smallest
excuse for imagining that you care for him in
the least; and I’ll try to impress upon him that
my friend, Miriam Heath, is a prize far beyond
the deserts of any man of my acquaintance,
barring one who is already appropriated,” she
added, laughingly.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Thank you. That is even more than I
could ask,” Miriam said, with a smile. “Serena,
you and the doctor must stay to tea.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Thank you, kindly, but we must hurry
home on account of the children. Besides, the
doctor has a call to make before tea,” Mrs.
Jasper answered. Then, drawing out her watch,
“Ah! it is time we were off now. I must run
in again and remind Alonzo.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008' >The doctor set his wife down at their own
gate, then drove on to make the call she
had spoken of. Serena stood still for a moment,
sending glances up and down the street, debating
in her own mind whether she should or
should not run over to Charlton’s office, less
than a square away, and say a few words that
were burning on the tip of her tongue.</p>

<p class='c009' >The question was decided for her by seeing
him approaching.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Good-evening, sir,” she said, nodding and
smiling; “won’t you come in?”</p>

<p class='c009' >He returned her greeting and accepted her
invitation, asking, “Have you some news for
me? I seem to read tidings in your face.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes; I have found out to a certainty that
you were wrong and I was right in that little
talk we had the other day.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Pardon me, but I am not quite sure that I
understand to what you refer, my good lady,” he
said, lightly, following her into the porch, where
she gave him a chair, taking another near at
hand herself.</p>

<p class='c009' >“I am just from Lakeside,” she said, giving
him a mischievous look and smile. “I’ve had
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_221' id='Page_221'>221</a></span>
a private interview with my friend Miriam, and
learned from her own lips that she utterly detested
Bangs on account of his odious character,
and that her emotion on hearing of his awful
end was because he had gone directly from an
interview with her, in which her firm refusal to
accept the offer of his hand had put him in a
towering passion, and that had led to his murder
of Barney Nolan, for which, as you know, he
was lynched. So poor, dear Miriam felt at the
time of hearing what had happened that she
was partly responsible for their deaths, and she
can’t even yet quite put aside the feeling.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Charlton’s countenance had grown radiant.</p>

<p class='c009' >“A thousand thanks, my dear Mrs. Jasper!”
he exclaimed; “you have lifted a load from
my mind, for, as I see you have already guessed,
I am deeply in love with Miss Miriam. Yet,
after all,” he sighed, a look of doubt and uncertainty
taking the place of the other, “I may fail
to win the prize I so covet, for I am quite sensible
that it is far beyond my deserts.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I entirely agree with you, sir,” she said,
teasingly. “I know of no one (now in the
market) whom I consider worthy of Miriam
Heath. She is, in my estimation, a diamond of
the first water.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“She is, indeed! And you would discourage
me from seeking to win her?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“No; there’s nothing like trying. As far as
I know she does not dislike you, and who can
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_222' id='Page_222'>222</a></span>
tell but you might in time, by clever courting,
teach her to really care for you? I will say
for your consolation that I think you as worthy
of her as any other unmarried man of my acquaintance.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Thank you,” he said. “You found them
all well at Lakeside?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes, and rejoicing over a piece of good fortune—the
recovery of the stolen notes; though
where they came from is a profound secret.”</p>

<p class='c009' >She enjoyed his surprise and pleasure, and in
answer to a question or two, went on to give
him the whole story, adding that he was to be
sent for to attend to the business arrangements
for them.</p>

<p class='c009' >“I’ll go over at once and save them the
trouble of sending,” he said, rising. “Good-evening.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Good-evening,” she responded. “Come
back and report, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009' >He only gave her a bow and smile, then hastened
on his way.</p>

<p class='c009' >The Lakeside family were just about to sit
down to tea when he arrived, and, of course,
he was invited to partake with them.</p>

<p class='c009' >They had their business talk at the table.</p>

<p class='c009' >On the conclusion of the meal all repaired to
the porch except Miriam, who, leaving the entertainment
of the guest to her grandmother
and Ronald, stole quietly out into the garden,
and busied herself among her flowers.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_223' id='Page_223'>223</a></span>
She was training a vine over a trellis, when a
familiar step on the walk startled her slightly
and deepened the color on her cheek; then a
voice close at her side said, “Let me help you.
My superior height will give me an advantage
in training those taller tendrils.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Thank you,” she answered, accepting his
offer, but without looking round, and feeling
her cheeks grow hot, for she knew instinctively
what was coming.</p>

<p class='c009' >He praised the beauty of the vine; then presently
they turned from it to the flower-beds,
and for a little made conversation about them.</p>

<p class='c009' >Neither felt a very deep interest in the subject-matter
of discourse at that moment; there
was shortly a pause in the stream of talk, and
summoning up all his courage, Warren began
upon the theme that lay nearest his heart.</p>

<p class='c009' >He told Miriam frankly that he loved her and
wanted to make her his wife; that she had
attracted him strongly from the first hour of
their acquaintance, and more and more as he
learned to know her better and perceived the
beauty of her character, till months ago she had
become so dear to his heart that he felt he
should be able to find little joy in life without
her sweet companionship; that he had refrained
from speaking till now only because of his
straitened circumstances, but lately he had
learned that an investment had turned out remarkably
well, and as he had now a constantly
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_224' id='Page_224'>224</a></span>
increasing and lucrative practice, he felt justified
in making her an offer of his heart and
hand, having a reasonable prospect of being
able to support her in comfort.</p>

<p class='c009' >He paused, but receiving no reply, went on
again.</p>

<p class='c009' >“I feel, dear Miss Miriam, that your worth
is far beyond my deserts, but I am sure no one
could love you better or be more earnestly and
sincerely determined to do all in his power to
make your life bright and happy.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Still no reply.</p>

<p class='c009' >“I fear I have not won your heart,” he
sighed, “but, dear girl, can you not give me
a little hope that I may be able to do so in
time?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I thank you sincerely for your generous
offer, Captain Charlton,” she responded at last,
speaking in low, tremulous tones, and with
half-averted face, “but—but—I think I cannot
be spared from home; I think grandmother,
the children, Ronald, all need me. Grandmother
is too old to bear alone the burden of
household cares and responsibilities, and Ronald
is not yet strong enough to take charge of the
farm.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I see it all,” he said; “your noble, self-sacrificing
spirit increases my esteem and affection,
and I would not ask you to forsake a duty for
my sake; but can you not give me some hope
for the future?”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_225' id='Page_225'>225</a></span>
“I do not approve of long engagements,”
she said, evasively.</p>

<p class='c009' >“We need not settle the question of its length
at present,” he said, in ardent tones, taking
her hand and raising it to his lips; “only let
me know that you care for me even a very
little, and I shall not despair of winning you at
last.”</p>

<p class='c009' >She did not refuse or withdraw the hand he
had taken, nor did she repulse him when he
ventured upon more pronounced demonstrations
of love.</p>

<p class='c009' >He drew her hand within his arm and led her
to an arbor at the foot of the garden.</p>

<p class='c009' >There time passed very swiftly, and the moon
was already shining in the sky when they returned
to the house with faces radiant with
happiness, and the captain announced to Mrs.
Heath and Ronald, whom they found alone
together on the porch, that he and Miriam were
plighted to each other for life.</p>

<p class='c009' >“But I am not going to leave you yet, dear
grandmother,” Miriam said, in low, tremulous
tones, as the old lady folded her to her heart
and wept over her in mingled joy and grief.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Oh, my darling, I don’t know what we
could ever do without you!” she sobbed, holding
the dear girl in a close embrace; “and yet
I could not for a moment think of standing in
the way of your happiness, dear, unselfish child
that you are, and have always been!”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_226' id='Page_226'>226</a></span>
“Surely there’s no need of either alternative,”
said Ronald, jocosely; “we’ve only to
take Warren in and make him a permanent addition
to the family—a valuable one he will be,
too. So, young folks, I give you my blessing,
and gracefully accept the situation.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Certainly it would be a delightful arrangement
for us, Ronald,” the old lady said. “We
are willing to share our dear Miriam with you,
Captain Charlton, if you will not rob us of her
altogether.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“There will be plenty of time to talk it over,
grandma, before anything need be settled,”
Miriam said, with a blush and a shy glance up
into her lover’s face.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Yes,” he said, with a proud, fond look at
her; “I appreciate your kindness, dear madam,
and could not find it in my heart to make so
mean a return as to rob you of your rightful
share in one who owes much of her lovely
womanhood to your tender care and training.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XX.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008' >Miriam woke the next morning with a
lighter and happier heart than she had carried
in her bosom for years; ever since the tide
to the cruel War of the Rebellion had swept
away the father upon whom she had been wont
to lean from early infancy, her young shoulders
had borne burdens all too heavy for their
strength.</p>

<p class='c009' >But now one as strong and even dearer than
that loved and honored parent had come forward
with gallant, tender entreaties that she
would let him bear them for her; he would do
it from love, and he was no less capable than
willing. What a rest it would be to lean on his
strength and look to him for guidance and support
in the trials and duties of life!</p>

<p class='c009' >She was up earlier than her wont, though it
was a rare occurrence, indeed, when the sun
found her in her bed, and came down-stairs
with a glad song upon her lips.</p>

<p class='c009' >Sandy met her in the lower hall. “Gude-mornin’,
Miss Mirry,” he said, and she noticed
a slight tremble in his voice, a distressed look
on his face.</p>

<p class='c009' >It stopped the song on her lips, and set her
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_228' id='Page_228'>228</a></span>
heart to beating faster with a nameless fear
(such dreadful, dreadful things had happened
of late).</p>

<p class='c009' >“Sandy, what is wrong?” she asked, catching
at the balustrade for support.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Naething to fright ye, Miss Mirry,” he
said, reassuringly, “but come wi’ me and I’ll
show ye,” leading the way out through the
porch into the garden. “I hae but just found
her, the poor, lone creature, and I want you to
tell me what shall be done wi’ her.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Who, Sandy? Of whom are you talking?”
queried Miriam, following, and with difficulty
keeping close to him, as he passed with hurried
steps around the house and down the path that
led to the barn-yard and the fields beyond.</p>

<p class='c009' >“I’ll show ye in a minute, Miss Mirry. I
dinna ken who she is, an’ I much doot if ye’re
ony wiser than mysel’ on that point, but she’s
in an awfu’ condition, and canna be lang for
this warld.”</p>

<p class='c009' >In another moment he had halted beside a
haystack, at the foot of which lay a woman
clothed in filthy rags, pale, dishevelled, unconscious,
lying with closed eyes, but moaning
feebly as if in pain.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Poor, poor creature!” cried Miriam, leaning
over her and dropping hot tears on the
pallid face. “Oh, Sandy, who can she be? and
what has brought her to this? She doesn’t
look like a gypsy, I don’t think she is a foreigner;
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_229' id='Page_229'>229</a></span>
but, oh, what she must have suffered!
What can we do for her?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Not much, I fear, my dear young leddy,”
answered McAllister. “She’s dyin’, I think,
and I dinna ken whether she could be moved
without hastenin’ the end that canna be far off.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“The doctor must be sent for at once,” said
Miriam, with decision.</p>

<p class='c009' >“I’ve started Peter off for him already,” returned
McAllister, “and na doot he’ll be here
afore lang.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Could we give her anything in the mean
time?—food or medicine?” Miriam asked. “She
looks famished.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“She does that, Miss Mirry.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Stay by her and I’ll run to the house for
some warm milk,” Miriam said, speeding away
as she spoke.</p>

<p class='c009' >She was back again almost immediately, and
Sandy raising the poor woman’s head, she
poured a little of the milk into her mouth. After
several trials they succeeded in getting her to
swallow a few drops, but she did not open her
eyes.</p>

<p class='c009' >By that time Dr. Jasper had arrived, and Captain
Charlton with him. They looked at the
wanderer, then exchanged grave, significant
glances.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Do you know her?” asked Miriam, and
both answered, “It is Belinda Himes.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Is it possible!” exclaimed Miriam, in low,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_230' id='Page_230'>230</a></span>
moved tones. “Doctor, can, you do nothing
for her?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Nothing!” he sighed; “she is dying—will
live but a few minutes, I think.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Dying,” cried Miriam, deeply moved;
“and, oh, I fear she is not ready for heaven!”</p>

<p class='c009' >Dropping on her knees by the side of the
poor creature, and putting her lips to her ear,
“Look to Jesus,” she said, in pitying accents;
“He is your only hope in this hour, but ‘He
is able to save to the uttermost;’ look and
live! Oh, cry to Him at once, ‘Lord, save or
I perish!’”</p>

<p class='c009' >“I think she does not hear you,” the doctor
said, with emotion.</p>

<p class='c009' >“Hark! she seems to be trying to speak,”
said Mrs. Heath, who had joined the little
group a moment before.</p>

<p class='c009' >At that a deep silence fell on them, each ear
being intent to catch the words that presently
came slowly, gaspingly, from the pale lips already
stiffening in death—“The—way—of—trans—gressors—is
hard.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Her eyes remained closed; she did not seem
conscious of their presence or of anything; two
or three long-drawn breaths followed the words,
and then all was still.</p>

<p class='c009' >A moment’s solemn silence, broken by the
voice of Sandy McAllister in low, moved tones,
“Poor, misguided creature! she has, na doot,
proved the truth o’ those words o’ inspiration
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_231' id='Page_231'>231</a></span>
in the sad experience o’ the past few weeks.
She’s been in hiding frae the law, and has died
o’ want an’ misery.”</p>

<p class='c009' >They gave her decent burial, paying the expense
out of the money left by her husband.
They knew of no relative or friend to summon
to her obsequies, and there was no one to drop
a tear of affection upon her lonely grave. She
and Phelim O’Rourke were reaping in another
world what they had sown in this.</p>

<p class='c009' >Deprived of their leader, and fearing to share
his fate at the hands of those who had dealt out
stern justice to him, the rest of the band had
fled the vicinity, and peace, quietness, and
security reigned all up and down Wild River
Valley; but the story of its tragedy will linger
for years, if not forever, in the minds of its
inhabitants—a tragedy that was largely the result
of a disregard on the part of the law-makers
of the State of that law of God—“Whoso sheddeth
man’s blood, by man shall his blood be
shed.”</p>
